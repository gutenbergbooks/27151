<p>The news of the splendid victory of the 12th of July was received in
England with enthusiasm. After it became known that the squadron under
Sir James Saumarez had been so materially damaged at Algeziras, it was
thought impossible that the ships could have been prepared to meet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
the enemy in so short a time. The Admiral's despatches, subsequently
to the first battle, stated that an overwhelming force had been sent
to Algeziras from Cadiz; and, consequently, the news of his subsequent
triumph over so great a superiority of force struck every person with
astonishment.</p>

<p>Battle of the 12th July 1801, when two Spanish ships of
the line were burnt, and one French 74 taken by Rear-admiral
Sir James Saumarez in the Straits of Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The Louisa brig, Lieutenant Truscott, having on board Lieutenant
Dumaresq, arrived off Mount's Bay on the 30th July. This officer
landed with Sir James's despatches, and immediately proceeded to
London. He was received at the Admiralty by Earl St. Vincent in the
most gratifying manner. Mr. Addington, then prime minister, sent an
express to Sir James's youngest brother at Brighton, requesting his
presence in London; and, on his arrival, he in the handsomest manner
presented him with a situation of trust and importance in the island
of Ceylon, with a salary of two thousand pounds per annum. Lieutenants
Dumaresq of the Cæsar, Jackson of the Superb, and Lillicrap of the
Venerable, were promoted to the rank of commanders.</p>

<p>The extraordinary public sensation which this important and unexpected
victory created, is described in the following letter from Mrs.
Saumarez of Newington, (Sir James's sister-in-law,) to whom Lieutenant
Dumaresq paid a visit on leaving the Admiralty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">London, 5th August 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Sir James,</p>

<p> It is impossible to express the admiration and enthusiasm which your
late despatches have excited in the breasts of all ranks of people. You
are now the theme of every conversation, the toast of every table, the
hero of every woman, and the boast of every Englishman. When Dumaresq
waited on Lord St. Vincent, his lordship squeezed his hand in the
greatest rapture, exclaiming, "I knew it,&mdash;I knew it,&mdash;I knew the
man,&mdash;I knew what he could do! It is the most daring thing that has been
done this war. It is the first thing.&mdash;I knew it would be so!" He then
gave Dumaresq his commission, and wrote a letter of congratulation to
Lady Saumarez, which he charged Phil. Dumaresq to deliver with his own
hand. I trust they are now both together; and, after staying there one
day, Phil. is to return to town.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>Lord St. Vincent also sent Dumaresq to Mr. Addington, who received him
in the most gracious manner. He told Phil. everything that man could say
in terms of approbation; and justly added, that, however the multitude
might estimate and admire the last action, yet the first, in his own
mind, and in the minds of men who understood the matter, was equally
deserving of praise, and would have fixed their approbation of Sir
James's conduct, even though he had failed in his second attempt. At the
same time he owned, that the exertions made by the men after the first
action, in order to meet the second, were beyond conception or example.
Indeed, they must surpass Mr. Addington's conception, since even Lord
St. Vincent told Dumaresq that it was far beyond what he himself could
imagine. In short, my dear Sir James, you have been achieving a deed
that has held you up to the contemplation of mankind, and that secures
you the gratitude of your country.</p>

<p>You will, no doubt, soon receive very distinguished marks of the royal
and the national favour. In the mean time you will be delighted, equally
with ourselves, to find that the stream of prosperity, beginning to flow
towards you, has already involved your brother Nicholas, who was sent
for yesterday from Brighton, in order to wait on Mr. Addington to-morrow
morning. It can be for no other purpose than to make his fortune. God
knows the poor fellow has suffered enough on your account! for we had
the rascally French despatches full ten days before we received yours;
and, when we did receive the first account, your brother Richard was not
satisfied. He feared the business was not done, and his mind dwelt upon
it with anxiety. At last, on the 1st of August, and not before, all our
fears were removed; and yesterday we received the news that Mr.
Addington had sent for Nicholas.</p>

<p> Indeed, Sir James, you have electrified your whole circle of friends in
a masterly manner; for the very great success you experienced at last,
came with double effect upon those who had greatly feared for you at the
first: and, let me add, that not only your actions, but your letters
also, are very much admired, and, I think, most deservedly.</p>

<p> Dumaresq is just like yourself,&mdash;unassuming and unaffected. He had been
with us an hour with his commission in his pocket, without telling us of
it; and it was only accidentally that we discovered he had been
promoted.</p>

<p> And now, my dear Sir James, let me speak like an <i>old woman</i>. I tremble
for you. Had you only dangers and difficulties to encounter, I should
not fear; but now you are going to be overwhelmed with wealth, titles,
fame, adulation, and distinction; with everything, in short, that can
make a man forget himself;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p class="left25">"And Satan, wiser than he was of yore,<br />
Now tempts by making rich, not making poor!"</p>

<p> Now, if in such a situation you can retain the two pillars of your
Christian faith, namely, humility and patience, you will then be the
first of human characters. Alas! how seldom it is that we see the
characters of the hero and the philosopher blended in one! When the head
monopolises the spirits, the heart often wants courage; and, if the
heart is strong, the head is weak. But, as no part of you has yet
betrayed signs of weakness, endeavour to preserve yourself the same in
future as</p> you have been in the past, however your fortunes may alter.

<p> God bless you, my dear brother! and God bless also Captain Brenton, and
all the heroes that are with you, and bring you safe back again to enjoy
the favours of your grateful country! M &mdash;&mdash; is here very happy. She sent
to the Bank yesterday for money, and requested to have cash instead of
notes. She was refused of course, at first; but when Mr. Brock said,
that, upon his honour, the money was for Sir James Saumarez's <i>sister</i>,
the guineas made their appearance immediately. I give you this as a
specimen of what people think of you. Two engravers have called on us
for your picture; and I have written to Lady Saumarez to let them have
it. I hope her ladyship and Captain Dumaresq are now in high chat.</p>

<p class="left60">I remain, dear brother,<br />
<span class="i4">Ever truly yours,</span></p>
<p class="right">M.S.</p>

<p> P.S. Richard desires his love; but you have deprived him of sleep.</p>

<p> As you could think on Mrs. Pope at the time you were undertaking the
most desperate attempt that ever was made, you may probably find time to
inquire for Horace T. who is now at Gibraltar hospital mending two
broken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> thighs. He is the son of Mrs. T. whom you have met at our house.
She keeps a ladies' school next door to us; and, could you serve her
son, you would help the widow and the fatherless, and please me at the
same time.</p></div>

<p>The following letters from Earl St. Vincent, and his secretary Mr.
Tucker, will demonstrate the high estimation in which the victory of
the 12th of July was held at the Admiralty.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Admiralty, 5th August 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Sir</p>

<p> I have to acknowledge your letters of the 30th June, 5th, 6th, 7th,
9th, 13th July, and to congratulate you most heartily on the career of
glory you and your gallant squadron have run in the course of those
periods. The hardy enterprise of the 6th merited complete success; but
all who know the baffling winds in the Bay of Gibraltar can readily
account for the event of it. The astonishing efforts made to refit the
crippled ships in Gibraltar Mole surpasses everything of the kind within
my experience; and the final success in making so great an impression on
the very superior force of the enemy crowns the whole. I have great
satisfaction in reporting to you that I have received the most gracious
and full approbation of his Majesty this morning of your whole conduct,
and that of every officer and man under your command, and I hear nothing
but praise and admiration from every quarter.</p>

<p>We wait impatiently the arrival of Vice-admiral Pole from the Baltic to
detach a powerful reinforcement to you, and we are not without hopes
that four ships of the line are on their passage from Cork to join you
before Cadiz, or at Gibraltar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>Having, from the moment of your departure, felt the most perfect
confidence that everything would be performed for the honour and success
of his Majesty's arms within the reach of human power, I have only to
add my anxious wish that another opportunity will present itself, ere
long, for a further display of that talent and intrepidity from which
the country has, upon so many occasions, received important benefits.</p>

<p class="left50">I have the honour to be<br />
<span class="i1">With the most perfect regard and esteem,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Very sincerely yours,</span></p>
<p class="right smcap">St. Vincent.</p>
<p>To Sir James Saumarez.</p>
<hr class="c15" />
<p class="right">Admiralty, 10th August 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I congratulate you from my heart and soul, and assure you that I rejoice
most sincerely in the glorious events you have achieved. I but feebly
express what I feel on this occasion. It has been your good fortune,
sir, to bear so large a part in accomplishing the most glorious actions
of this eventful war, that you can scarcely have had an opportunity of
witnessing their immediate effect on the public mind; but, be assured,
in no instance has there been more lively admiration expressed of the
intrepidity and indefatigable zeal of our navy, than has been shown by
all ranks, of your most gallant enterprises, even before the account of
your first action was received; and I am sure you will excuse me for
adding the tribute my noble lord paid on that occasion, who, when he
read the French account that they had taken the Hannibal, exclaimed, "We
may have lost a ship, but I well know the man and the men who are there,
and I'll pledge my life the nation has lost no honour!" The instant
despatch of the ships from Ireland will prove that it was not conceived
possible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> for you to have so soon refitted the squadron, which has been
the subject of great admiration and surprise.</p>

<p>The noble and liberal conduct of the squadron in admitting the Pompée
and Hannibal to partake of their prize-money is an honourable and
beautiful contrast to the bickerings which have arisen lately respecting
joint captures, and must ensure success to every claim that can be made
out; but I am afraid we shall not be able to find a precedent for
anything beyond head-money being given for ships which have been blown
up in action.</p>

<p class="right smcap">B. Tucker.</p></div>

<p>We shall now return to the proceedings at Gibraltar, where we left the
squadron of Sir James Saumarez, after the glorious battle of the 12th
July.</p>

<p>The extreme degree of excitement and enthusiasm, sharpened by revenge,
which supported the gallant crew of the Cæsar, and enabled them to
perform such prodigious labour during the last seven days, had now
subsided. The incessant fatigue which they had endured, both of body
and mind, their long abstinence from their natural sleep, and the
sudden change from bustle to inactivity, threw the whole of the men
into such a state of languor and debility, that they were found lying
on the bare planks of the deck, having sunk exhausted, and incapable
of making any exertion. This state of stupor continued several hours;
some days, indeed, elapsed before many of them regained their usual
strength and spirits. At length, however, the men again began to
refit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> the ship, and prepare for resuming the blockade of Cadiz.</p>

<p>Nothing could surpass the attention, kindness, and hospitality of the
governor and garrison of Gibraltar, who were, by the signal defeat of
the combined squadron, happily relieved from a state of siege.
Invitations from every quarter were given; but Sir James, who was
averse to adulation, declined all except those of the governor, which
he considered it his duty not to refuse. No time was lost in sending
the men who were saved from the unfortunate Real Carlos to Algeziras;
and Sir James entered into a correspondence with the governor, and
subsequently with the commander-in-chief at Cadiz, for an exchange of
prisoners, which, as the circumstances were now different from those
which lately existed, was acceded to without waiting for the
permission of the Minister of Marine at Paris. Consequently the whole
of the Hannibal's men were sent to Gibraltar, in exchange for the crew
of the San Antonio, which ship was surveyed, taken into the service,
and commissioned. On this occasion the following promotions took
place.</p>

<p>Commander the Hon. Geo. H.L. Dundas, of the Calpé, was appointed
captain of the San Antonio, now called the St. Antoine; Lieut.
Lamburn, first of the Cæsar, to command the Calpé; Mr. Beard, master's
mate of the Cæsar, to be lieutenant of the St. Antoine, to which ship
the purser and warrant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> officers of the Thames, also, were appointed.
Mr. Champion, secretary to Sir James, was made purser of the Thames,
while warrant officers were selected from the class of petty officers
in the Cæsar; Mr. John Brenton was appointed to fill the vacancy of
lieutenant in the Cæsar; Lieutenant Janvrin was made first lieutenant
of the St. Antoine; and the other vacancies for lieutenants were
filled up from the other ships, viz. Messrs. Curry and Hillier of the
Pompée, T. Dowel of the Venerable, E. Donovan of the Superb, and Mr.
J. Crawfurd, master of the El Carmen, were made acting lieutenants to
the said ships; while the marine officers of the Hannibal, Lieutenant
(now Colonel) Connolly, and Lieutenant Dunford, were also transferred
with the marines of that ship to the prize. All these appointments
were transmitted to, but not confirmed by, the Admiralty, excepting
Captain Dundas, and Captain Dumaresq, who was subsequently appointed
to the Calpé.</p>

<p>As the correspondence between Sir James and the Spanish
commander-in-chief is highly creditable to both, and as it clears up a
doubt which may still exist, we give an exact copy from the original
letters, which were exchanged by a flag of truce.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">H.M.S. Cæsar, off Cadiz, 17th August 1801.</p>

<p>Having been informed that reports were circulated in Spain, ascribing
the destruction of the two first-rates, Real <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>Carlos and San
Hermenegildo, in the engagement of the 12th July last, to red-hot balls
from his Majesty's ships under my command, I take this present
opportunity to contradict, in the most positive and formal manner, a
report so injurious to the characteristic humanity of the British
nation, and to assure your Excellency that nothing was more void of
truth. This I request you will be pleased to signify in the most public
way possible. To assuage, as far as lay in my power, the miseries that
must necessarily result from a state of warfare, has ever been my
strenuous endeavour, and such will be the rule of my conduct in carrying
on the blockade of Cadiz, or any other service committed to my charge.</p>

<p>I beg your Excellency to accept the renewal of my respectful regard; and
I have the honour to be,</p>

<p class="left25">With the highest consideration,<br />
<span class="i2">Your Excellency's most obedient and most humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right smcap">James Saumarez.</p>
<p>To his Excellency Don Joseph de Mazzaredo, Commander-in-chief of his<br />
<span class="i2">Most Cath. Maj. ships, Cadiz.</span></p></div>

<p>The flag of truce, which had been sent into Cadiz with some
passengers, taken in a small vessel, and with the above letter,
returned with the following answer, of which we give a verbatim copy,
as a specimen of a foreigner's English:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="smcap">Esteemed Sir,</p>

<p>The reports which have been current, that the burning of the two royal
ships, on the nights of the 12th and 13th, arose from the use of red-hot
balls, which were fired at them, have existed only among the ignorant
public, and have not received credit from any persons of condition, who
well know the manner of combating of the British <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>navy. At the same time
they give the greatest credit to the assertion of your Excellency that
nothing could be more foreign from the truth, and the characteristic
humanity of the British nation. I have myself experience of the
particular conduct of your Excellency, conformable to your personal
character, and to that of your late commander-in-chief, his Excellency
Lord St. Vincent, in the manner in which, in the last blockade of Cadiz,
he reconciled with the duties of a state of war those attentions and
considerations to alleviate miseries not connected with the great
object, and to secure that good intelligence and friendship with which
two powers may suspend for a time treating each other as enemies; and I
have no doubt that such will always be the rule of your Excellency's
conduct.</p>

<p>In my particular circumstances, with an obligation to reside in this
capital, as Captain-general of the Marine department, the correspondence
in any urgent case of a flag of truce might suffer delay; and it would
be convenient for your Excellency to address yourself directly to Don
Joseph Herryar, Commandant-general of the province and army of
Andalusia, qui (who) resides in Cadiz.</p>

<p>I will avail myself of every occasion to assure your Excellency of the
esteem and consideration which I profess for your person.</p>

<p class="left50">God grant you may live a thousand years!<br />
<span class="i1">Your most obedient servant,</span></p>
<p class="right smcap">Joseph Mazzaredo.</p>
<p>Isle of Leon, 17th August 1801.</p></div>

<p>The following reply was sent by Sir James to the Spanish Admiral:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Cæsar, off Cadiz, 18th August 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have received the honour of your Excellency's letter, by which I am
extremely happy to find the reports of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> Real Carlos and San
Hermenegildo having been destroyed by red-hot balls from the squadron
under my orders have only been credited by the ignorant public, and not
by persons of higher condition in Spain. But as such reports, if
permitted to gain ground without being contradicted, must tend to
irritate the minds of the public, and occasion an animosity between the
two nations that ought not to exist, I trust your Excellency will be
pleased to comply with my request in causing the formal disavowal of it
to be publicly notified.</p>

<p>The very flattering manner in which your Excellency is pleased to
express yourself at my endeavours to alleviate the miseries attendant on
a state of warfare during the former blockade of Cadiz, under the orders
of the Earl of St. Vincent, afford me infinite satisfaction. It is by
pursuing similar conduct that I hope to deserve the approbation of the
King my royal master, and that of the English nation.</p>

<p>I shall comply with your Excellency's desire in order to accelerate the
communication of flags of truce, that they in future be addressed to his
Excellency the Governor-general of the province of Andalusia.</p>

<p>I beg your Excellency to accept my sincere and fervent wishes for your
health and every possible happiness, and my assurance of the sentiments
of most perfect regard with which I have the honour to be</p>

<p class="left60">Your Excellency's most obedient<br />
<span class="i1">and most humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</p>
<p>To his Excellency Don Joseph Mazzaredo, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>We need only add that Sir James's request was complied with, and that
several communications were subsequently made by flags of truce for
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> exchange of prisoners, by which the sufferings on both sides were
much alleviated.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>News of the battle of Algeziras, and of the loss of the Hannibal,
having reached the Admiralty through the French papers, their
lordships despatched a vessel with orders to Captain Tyler of the
Warrior, who with six sail of the line was cruising off Ireland, to
proceed with his squadron to reinforce Sir James Saumarez off Cadiz.
These ships, viz. the Warrior, Captain Tyler; Defence, Lord H. Paulet;
Bellona, Captain Bertie; Russell, Captain Cuming, all of seventy-four
guns, and Eling, schooner, joined Captain Stirling of the Pompée on
the 9th; who, with Captain Keats in the Superb, had resumed the
blockade. Intelligence of this reinforcement was sent to Sir James at
Gibraltar.</p>

<p>A claim was made for prize-money, by Captain C. Duncan of the
Portuguese frigate Carlotta, but was not admitted; because, having
been informed that peace had been made between Portugal and France,
Captain Duncan had refused to take any part in the action, and had
been requested by Sir James merely to carry his despatches to Lisbon.</p>

<p>The Cæsar being refitted, Sir James made two attempts to join his
squadron off Cadiz; but it was not until the 15th of August that he
reached his station, having, in the mean time,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> twice visited Tangier.
The Thames had been sent with despatches to Lord Keith, who had
ordered the Généreux, Captain Manly Dixon, to leave Mahon, and join
the squadron off Cadiz; but this officer having heard of the second
action, and conceiving it would be unnecessary, did not join, but
wrote a letter, of which the following is an extract.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">H.M.S. Généreux, Minorca, E.N.E. 50 leagues, 24 July 1801.</p>

<p>This evening, being distant from the west end of Minorca, on my passage
to join you, I fell in with the brig with your second letter, addressed
to the senior officer at Mahon; and taking the same into consideration,
and the great advantage which your glorious and most brilliant action
with the French and Spanish squadrons must give you over the enemy off
Cadiz, I judged it best for his Majesty's service to return to my
station at Mahon, and act conformably to the last orders I received from
Sir John Warren,&mdash;which were, to hold the Généreux in constant readiness
to join him on his appearance off that port.</p>

<p>I beg leave to congratulate you, and the captains of your squadron, on
the great success which has attended your first dash at the enemy in
their strong position off Algeziras, and the very important consequence
of it.</p></div>

<p>At the same time Sir James received the first of the following letters
from Lord Keith, who had not yet received the accounts of the second
battle:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Foudroyant, Bay of Aboukir, 4th August 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I yesterday received your letters of the 7th and 9th ultimo, by the
Delight, from Minorca. The letter has given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> me much concern, in
consequence of the unfortunate issue of your gallant endeavours. I am
still in hopes that it will not turn out so favourably for the enemy,
and that some of their ships will be lost.</p>

<p>You will know, before this reaches you, that Cairo is evacuated. The
greatest part of its garrison is now embarked. When that is
accomplished, I see nothing to prevent our beginning to attack
Alexandria; and I am sanguine that it cannot hold out long: but, until
it is in our power, I can detach nothing from blockading that port, and
covering this immense fleet of transports, store-ships, victuallers,
&amp;c. which have no other protection. Besides, the army cannot exist
without our protection.</p>

<p>Sir John Warren sailed from hence on the 12th May. I have since heard
from him, at sea and at Malta; and I have lately understood that he was
off Cape Spartavento, where he may have heard of Gantheaume's squadron;
but his ultimate orders are for Mahon, at which place he must now be
with seven ships of the line. The Athenian must now be ready to join,
from Malta. Should the enemy sail up the Mediterranean, Carthagena or
Toulon must be their first rendezvous, where you will be able to observe
them, when joined to Sir John; and, from all information, their objects
of attack must be confined to three,&mdash;Egypt, Turkey in Europe, or
Sicily, in the event of a renewal of hostilities: and to those objects I
recommend the strictest attention; because, after the island of Minorca
is sufficiently reinforced, it may be left, for a longer time than
before, without very much danger: but I must recommend that the
strictest secrecy is observed on my intended operation, and that
frequent information is transmitted to me.</p>

<p>Were the enemy once collected at any one point, I could venture to
detach from hence; but, unsettled as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> they are at present, it would be a
measure of much danger. The ships last from England sail very ill; and,
if met with, would be taken. The Hector, Ajax, and La Diane, lately ran
foul of each other at sea, and are not yet in a state to act.</p>

<p>It will be proper to keep the cruisers active off Carthagena, Barcelona,
and Crette, whence the enemy must derive their supplies; and whichever
port the enemy's squadron goes into, must be blockaded <i>de facto</i>; and
any vessels that attempt to enter, after due warning, must be detained.
I beg to mention that the anchorage of Alendia Bay is good. If not
better defended than I have known it to be, the batteries might be
destroyed by a few soldiers from General Fox: a position there covers
both sides of the island. The idea of an attack on Maracoa, or Algiers,
I discredit: at the first place their army would be lost; at the second
they could not trust their fleet in so open a bay even for a week.</p>

<p>I hope you will send to the Admiralty copies of all your letters to me
on points of service, whilst I am at such a distance from you.</p>

<p class="left55">I have the honour to be,<br />

<hr class="c15" />
<p class="right">Foudroyant, Aboukir Bay, 17th August 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have had the honour of receiving your letter of the 19th ultimo,
acquainting me with the measures which you had adopted for opposing the
return to Cadiz of the combined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> French and Spanish squadrons lately
anchored in Algeziras Bay; and with the fortunate result of your attack
on them, with an inferiority of force that little encouraged an
expectation of so distinguished an advantage. I beg to offer to you my
sincere congratulations on the successful issue of an enterprise, so
honourable to yourself; and request you will accept the tribute of my
perfect approbation of the ardent zeal and determined resolution which
animated you on that important occasion; and that you will communicate
my full satisfaction and approbation to all the captains and officers,
seamen and marines, of the ships of the squadron under your orders, who,
by so eminently distinguishing themselves, have merited and obtained
yours.</p>

<p class="left50">I have the honour to be,<br />
<span class="i1">Sir,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Your most obedient humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right smcap">Keith.</p>
<p>To Rear-admiral Sir James Saumarez, Bart.<br />
<span class="i2">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</span></p>
<hr class="c15" />
<p class="right">(Same date.)</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have to acknowledge the receipt of the various enclosures in your
letters of the 19th July; and approve of the exertions to resume the
station before Cadiz with the ships of your squadron, which, I have
reason to believe, has been seasonably reinforced by the Généreux.</p>

<p>The Honourable Captain Dundas shall receive an appointment for the San
Antonio, which, I have no doubt, the repeated meritorious conduct of
that young officer will induce their lordships to confirm; and I shall
have pleasure in paying attention to the other officers, to whom you
have given acting orders, when a compliance with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> their lordships'
commands, and an attention to prior engagements, shall enable me so to
do.</p>

<p class="left50">I have the honour to be your obedient servant,</p>
<p class="right smcap">Keith.</p>
<p>To Rear-admiral Sir James Saumarez, Bart.<br />
<span class="i2">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</span></p></div>

<p>Sir James, at the same time, received the usual order, dated 3rd
August, to place himself under the orders of Lord Keith; by which it
was supposed that his lordship had no right to share, as
commander-in-chief, for the prizes antecedently taken by the squadron.
This question, however, was decided in favour of his lordship.</p>

<p>The Bellona, Penelope, and Mermaid successively joined the squadron;
and the latter, having a convoy from Lisbon, was despatched with it to
Malta. The Audacious and Bellona were sent to Gibraltar to refit; and
subsequently the Penelope, to be hove down. Sir James received letters
from Mr. Frere, at Lisbon, by the Phaeton, Captain Morris, informing
him of the conclusion of peace between Portugal and France; and of a
report that some of the enemy's ships had escaped from Brest, which
was however contradicted by despatches of later date from the Channel
fleet, and from England. The enemy's designs had been completely
frustrated, and vessels employed in the commerce of Great Britain
proceeded to their various destinations without molestation. The
Phaeton was also despatched up the Mediterranean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> with a convoy, and
with information of importance for Lord Keith, from Mr. Frere. By the
return of the Thames, Sir James received from Sir John Warren, whose
absence from Toulon had permitted Admiral Linois' squadron to escape,
the following letter, dated,</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Renown, Port Mahon, 18th August, 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honour of informing you of my arrival here with the squadron
under my command, being ordered by the commander-in-chief on this part
of the station, and to assist and communicate with anything stationed
without the Straits' mouth.</p>

<p>I received, with much satisfaction, the intelligence of your zealous and
gallant efforts with the squadron under your orders in the several
actions you have had with the enemy, the result of which has proved so
successful and honourable to all who assisted in them.</p>

<p>I therefore beg leave, sincerely, to offer you my congratulations on
this occasion; and trust you have received the stores sent from this
dockyard, and the supernumeraries which were conveyed in the Mermaid.</p>

<p>I am sorry to add that the Swiftsure was captured by Gantheaume in her
passage with some merchantmen, on the coast of Barbary; and that the
enemy were fortunate enough to carry her into Toulon.</p>

<p class="left50">I have the honour to remain,<br />
<span class="i1">Your obedient humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right smcap">J.B. Warren.</p>
<p>To Rear-admiral Sir James Saumarez, Bart. <br />
<span class="i2">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</span></p></div>

<p>The ports of Cadiz and St. Lucar were now declared to be in strict
blockade, which was rigidly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> enforced, in order to prevent supplies
being thrown in for the repairs of the damaged fleet; and serious
disputes frequently took place between the French and Spaniards in
these harbours.</p>

<p>Although the battles of the 6th and 12th of July were not in magnitude
to be compared to those of the Nile and Valentine's day, they were to
the nation actually of no less importance, by having put an end to the
well-laid plan of Buonaparte for the destruction of our commerce and
the reinforcement of his army in Egypt, which Gantheaume had
unsuccessfully attempted.</p>

<p>Peace having been made between France and Spain, it was agreed that
the fleet of the latter nation, partly manned with French crews and
officers, should be joined by Linois' squadron from Toulon, and then
proceed off Lisbon, which they were to sack, and destroy or capture
the British merchant-ships lying there with rich cargoes; then, being
reinforced by the Brest fleet, they were to pass the Straits of
Gibraltar, and with an overwhelming force steer direct for Alexandria,
where they were to land such a body of troops as would raise the
siege, and drive the English out of Egypt. This would certainly have
succeeded had the squadron under Linois not encountered that of Sir
James, which led to the total defeat of their combined fleets, and to
the abandonment of the grand plan: events which may be said to have
brought about the conclusion of peace, first, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> Portugal, and
subsequently with Great Britain, as it was found impossible to
relieve, or reinforce, the French army in Egypt before the
capitulation of Alexandria, and the final expulsion of that army. But
the reader will be surprised to find that the meritorious services of
Sir James, although fully acknowledged, were not so fully rewarded.</p>

<p class="p2"></p></div>

<p>Since the signal defeat of the French and Spanish combined squadrons
on the 12th of July, Sir James had passed seven most anxious weeks
without having received any communication from England.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> His
sufferings on that account, and his impatience for letters, as well
from his family as from the Admiralty, were, according to his own
admission, more intolerable than he had ever experienced.</p>

<p>The enemy's force at Cadiz being now so inferior, even to the squadron
he at first commanded, he was enabled to send the Audacious and
Bellona to refit at Gibraltar; while he detached the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> Warrior and the
Ph&oelig;be to cruise off Lisbon, and other smaller vessels in different
directions. He never doubted that he should be continued in the chief
command; and his hopes of the pleasing intelligence had been raised to
the highest pitch, when the long-expected despatches arrived. His
surprise and mortification, therefore, may be imagined, when, on
opening the very first letter from the Admiralty, he found himself
superseded by a senior officer, on a plea which had no just
foundation, namely, <i>the increase of the enemy's force at Cadiz</i>!
whereas, on the contrary, that force had not only been decreased by
the loss of two of its largest ships, but <i>all</i> the rest had been so
materially damaged in the late actions as to be rendered for the
present unserviceable.</p>

<p>As might be expected, Sir James felt so indignant at this, to say the
least of it, ill-timed arrangement, that he considered it a duty he
owed to his character to express his feelings strongly in a respectful
answer to this communication, both to the Board, and to Earl St.
Vincent; which produced an explanation, in which it appeared that the
Admiralty, having determined to make Cadiz a separate command from
that of the Mediterranean, it became necessary to employ two
flag-officers. Sir James being the last on the list, none could be
found junior; and they were, therefore, under the necessity of
appointing a senior officer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>As it could not be disputed that the Admiralty had a right to make the
dispositions for which they alone were responsible, the correspondence
in which Sir James's services were acknowledged, and wherein regret
was expressed by their lordships at the necessity they had been under
of appointing a senior officer, ended in a satisfactory manner; and
Sir James was contented to remain as second in command under
Vice-admiral Pole, who arrived on the 31st August, in the St. George,
to assume the chief command of the squadron.</p>

<p>Two of the letters which Sir James received on this occasion have been
given in the preceding chapter, in order to show the reception which
the intelligence of his victory met with in England. The following are
copies of the official letters alluded to, and also of some private
letters, which express his feelings on the occasion.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Admiralty, 2nd August 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I received, yesterday, by Captain Ferris, and immediately communicated
to my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, your letters of the 5th,
6th, 9th, and 10th instant, acquainting me, for their lordships'
information, that, having received intelligence of three French
line-of-battle ships and a frigate having anchored off Algeziras, you
had proceeded through the Straits, with the squadron under your orders,
for the purpose of attacking them, which you had accordingly done on the
morning of the 6th; but that the Hannibal having unfortunately taken the
ground, and all the endeavours you had exerted with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> the Cæsar and
Audacious having proved ineffectual, you had been compelled to withdraw
from the attack, and to leave the Hannibal in possession of the enemy;
transmitting, at the same time, a list of the killed and wounded, with a
copy of a letter you had received from Captain Ferris, giving an account
of his proceedings: and, in answer thereto, I have received their
lordships' commands to acquaint you that, although your endeavours to
destroy the enemy's ships, above-mentioned, were unsuccessful, they
cannot too much applaud the spirit and activity with which the attack
was conducted; and that, however they may regret the loss of the
Hannibal to his Majesty, their lordships have the satisfaction of
knowing that you, and all the officers and men employed under your
command, have faithfully and zealously discharged your duty, and
although by unfortunate circumstances a ship has been lost, as well as
the lives of many gallant officers and men, the national character has
in no degree suffered from the disaster.</p>

<p>Their lordships have the fullest confidence that every exertion will be
made for repairing the damage which the ships now with you have
sustained; and have commanded me to inform you that you may rely on
their taking measures immediately for reinforcing you, and for sending
such supplies of stores as the squadron may be likely to require.</p>

<p class="left60">I am, sir, your most obedient humble servant,</p>
<p class="right smcap">Evan Nepean.</p>
<p>To Sir James Saumarez, Bart.</p>
<hr class="c15" />

<p class="right">Admiralty Office, 4th August 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>After I had closed my despatch of the 2nd instant, Lieutenant Dumaresq
arrived, and delivered to me your letters of the 13th and 14th of last
month: the former,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> giving information that the three French ships of
the line and, a frigate, at Algeziras, having been joined by five
Spanish and one French sail of the line, with other smaller vessels, had
sailed on the morning of the 12th with his Majesty's late ship Hannibal,
for Cadiz; that, by the great exertions of the officers and men of the
squadron, you had been able to proceed to sea at the same time, with all
the ships under your orders, except the Pompée, in pursuit of the enemy;
and that, after a partial action, two Spanish ships of a hundred and
twelve guns had been blown up, and one French ship of seventy-four guns
had been taken by his Majesty's ship Superb: the latter transmitting a
letter which you had received from Captain Keats, of the last-mentioned
ship, containing an account of his proceedings on that occasion.</p>

<p>I lost no time in laying your said despatches before my Lords
Commissioners of the Admiralty; and I have received their lordships'
commands to express to you their highest approbation of the gallantry
and good conduct which were displayed by you, and the captains,
officers, and men under your orders, in engaging and defeating so
superior a force of the enemy; and to desire that you will signify to
them, particularly to Captains Hood and Keats, in the strongest terms,
the sense their lordships are pleased to entertain of their meritorious
services on this important occasion.</p>

<p>Their lordships have commanded me further to inform you that, in
consequence of the favourable mention you have made of the services of
the Honourable Captain Dundas and Lieutenant Dumaresq, they have been
pleased to promote the former to the rank of post-captain, and the
latter to command the Calpé.</p>

<p class="left60">I am, sir, your obedient humble servant,</p>
<p class="right smcap">Evan Nepean.</p>
<p>To Rear-admiral Sir James Saumarez, Bart.<br />
<span class="i2">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>
<hr class="c15" />

<p class="right">Admiralty Office, 14th August 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty having judged it necessary, from
the present circumstances of the war, and preparations now making by the
enemy in Cadiz, to augment the squadron serving on the coasts of
Portugal and Spain bordering on the Atlantic, and to place the ships and
vessels on that station under the command of Vice-admiral Pole, I have
received their commands to acquaint you of this arrangement, and to
enclose their orders to you, to put yourself, and the ships with you,
under the Vice-admiral's command.</p>

<p>So many objections occur to the allowing a force of the extent necessary
to be so employed, with only one flag-officer, that their lordships have
felt themselves reduced to the necessity, from your standing on the
list, of sending a senior officer to you; which, on considering the
proofs you have given of your zeal and ability, and the advantage which
the public has so recently derived from your very distinguished
services, they would, if possible, have avoided.</p>

<p class="left60">I am, sir, your most obedient humble servant,</p>
<p class="right smcap">Evan Nepean.</p>
<p>To Rear-admiral Sir James Saumarez, Bart.<br />
<span class="i2">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</span></p></div>

<p>The enclosures mentioned in the above letters being the usual official
order for Sir James to put himself under command of Vice-admiral
Charles Morice Pole, need not be inserted; nor the consequent order
from that officer to Sir James. The squadron was now augmented by four
sail of the line; namely, the St. George, 98 (flag-ship), Captain
Nichols; Dreadnought, 98, Captain Vashon;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> Russell, 74, Captain
Cuming; and Powerful, 74, Sir Francis Laforey: and on the 10th of
September the St. Antoine, Audacious, Zealous, and Bellona joined;
which, with the Cæsar, Superb, Venerable, Spencer, and Pompée, made
twelve sail of the line.</p>

<p>The subjoined extract of a letter which Sir James wrote to his brother
Richard, is sufficiently expressive of his feelings:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">2nd September 1801.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more strongly penned than the letters, both public and
private, which I have received. If I had destroyed thirty sail of
line-of-battle ships, they could not have been in a higher strain of
praise and admiration. But is it not surprising they should cease there?
Not a syllable is said of the first lieutenant, or anything intended for
myself. Your letter seemed to make certain of it, and you fully expect
that a peerage will be conferred on me at the meeting of Parliament,
with the grant of a suitable pension. I cannot but feel surprised that
Phil. Dumaresq should have been detained so long in London, and not be
charged with the smallest hint on the subject, which almost makes me
fear my services will be disregarded in the same manner I experienced
after the Nile.</p>

<p>I declare to you that on no service wherein I have been engaged have I
found any situation equally arduous as that of Algeziras, nor have known
any in the naval history of my country. Its consequences have been equal
to the most complete victory; for, with seven sail, of which my squadron
was composed, we have frustrated two important expeditions, the naval
force of which consisted of sixteen sail of the line.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
I have been encouraged to expect this mark of distinction by
all on this station, and I cannot express my feelings should it
not be conferred. I shall, however, follow my sister's advice
of "patience and humility" in either instance, and I trust to
my resignation should the injustice be done to me.</p>

<p>With regard to Mr. Pipon, he cannot do better than follow
Captain Martin in a line-of-battle ship as first lieutenant; it
will not prevent my exertions to serve him: but judge of the
injustice to those officers who have shared in this and several
other battles with me, to place a stranger over their heads.</p>

<p>The Cæsar will, I hope, in a short time, be ordered to
England; and I have written to be permitted to proceed in her,
which I trust will be complied with.</p>

<p>Is it not hard I should have been deprived of Lady Saumarez's
letters? It is, however, a consolation to know that she was in
good health so late as the 14th, by a letter to Captain
Dumaresq.</p></div>

<p>The loss of Lady Saumarez's letters, which had been sent unfortunately
to Plymouth, where the squadron which sailed from Portsmouth did not
touch, as was expected, added greatly to Sir James's disappointment;
as did also the information that Mr. Lamburn, who had been appointed
to the Calpé, was to return to the Cæsar, being superseded by Captain
Dumaresq; and that <i>none</i> of the appointments of the warrant-officers
to the St. Antoine were confirmed. It was, from these facts,
sufficiently evident that Sir James, in his honourable desire to
benefit those under his command, particularly Captains Hood and
Keats,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> had materially injured his own interest by permitting these
officers to make their own reports of the action at which he was
present commanding, and taking part. By thus omitting to give himself
and his own ship the full share of credit due to both, he actually
threw his officers and himself so completely into the back-ground,
that people were led to believe the Cæsar and the Admiral had little
or nothing to do with the battle. It is to this, and not to any
disinclination of Earl St. Vincent to reward Sir James, that his
services were on this occasion unrewarded,&mdash;the success being, by
these documents, attributed entirely to the Superb and Venerable; in
contemplation of which, the heavy responsibility, the ardent zeal, the
determined resolution Sir James had evinced, and, above all, the
important advantages gained to the nation by that victory which his
bravery and perseverance had obtained, were entirely overlooked. We
may justly ask, were the merits of the first lieutenant of the Superb,
which, in conjunction with the Cæsar, made an easy capture of the San
Antonio, and with a trifling loss,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> greater than those of the first
lieutenant of the flag-ship, which was engaged far more severely at
Algeziras, who exerted himself most zealously in refitting the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> ship,
besides assisting in the capture of the French ship? Yet the promotion
was only given to the first lieutenants of the Venerable and Superb,
although the former ship would probably have been taken had it not
been for the Cæsar, and the latter was not in the action of Algeziras
at all! These circumstances, and the fact that his appointments to the
St. Antoine were not confirmed, seem to have given Sir James more
concern than even the total neglect of his own meritorious services.</p>

<p>Taking into account every circumstance regarding the actions of the
6th and 12th July,&mdash;the severity of the former, the intermediate
exertions, the professional skill, the daring and the tact displayed
in the latter, and the complete discomfiture of the enemy's
well-arranged plans for the destruction of our commerce at Lisbon and
the subsequent relief of their army in Egypt,&mdash;this victory was equal
to, if not greater in importance than, either the battles of St.
Vincent or the Nile, for the former of which Jervis was created an
earl, and Nelson a baron for the latter, immediately on the arrival of
the news in England. Yet after a lapse of several months, after
praises had been heaped upon Sir James, after the thanks of both
houses of parliament had been voted to him for the fifth time, after
his eminent services had been acknowledged by every large corporation,
and generally throughout the kingdom&mdash;after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> the highest encomiums had
been pronounced on him by Earl St. Vincent and Lord Nelson,&mdash;instead
of a peerage, which he as richly deserved as either of the other two,
he was decorated only with the red riband.</p>

<p>We shall close this subject for the present by giving an extract from
a letter Sir James wrote to his friend Sir Thomas Troubridge, after
his correspondence with the Admiralty on the subject of his being
superseded had ended, and subsequently to his correspondence with the
Navy Board on his having commissioned the St. Antoine to employ the
crew of the Hannibal, which had been exchanged.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Cæsar, 7th October 1801.</p>

<p>I leave it to you to decide whether I had not just cause for
additional disappointment to find no notice taken of the
services of the squadron by the promotion of any of the
officers; and what I must feel at this moment to find Mr.
Lamburn sent back, and the lieutenants of the Superb and
Venerable alone promoted. I cannot but view it as a great
injustice done me, and I am sorry to say it mortifies me more
than I can express.</p>

<p>With regard to the St. Antoine, allow me to bring to your
recollection under what circumstances she was commissioned. At
that time I was ignorant of any part of our force having been
withdrawn from the Baltic, or that any ships could be spared
from the North Sea or the Channel fleet, and consequently could
not expect but that a very small, if any, reinforcement could
be ordered to join me;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> and to have left an efficient ship,
which, with the Hannibal's ship's company, could be brought
forward for service in so short a time, I should have deemed
myself very reprehensible, All the appointments were made in
the most fair and impartial manner; and I solemnly declare that
the sole view to the good of his Majesty's service was what
actuated the whole of my proceedings, which I am certain Hood
will also declare. I am truly grieved at the manner the
warrant-officers I appointed to that ship are ordered to be
superseded, and I shall feel it as long as I live.</p>

<p>Believe me, my good friend, my heart is incapable of harbouring so
heinous a vice as ingratitude, and I shudder at the thought of being
taxed with it: but when I consider the treatment I have received on
this occasion, I feel it difficult to support myself; and what adds to
my distress is, to find by your private note of the 19th that I am
likely to remain longer in this country. Let me assure you that I
shall ever retain a grateful sense of the many and uniform proofs of
your friendship for me, which I can truly say are not misplaced; there
being no one among your numerous friends who can have a more true
regard and sincere esteem for you than myself.</p>

<p class="right">J.S.</p></div>

<p>Sir James continued with the squadron under Sir Charles Pole, employed
on the blockade of Cadiz, until the 14th November 1801, when he went
in the Cæsar, in company with several other ships to Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The following letter from General O'Hara gave Sir James the first news
of the capitulation of Cairo, and the death of Sir Ralph Abercrombie,
on the 21st of August<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Gibraltar, 30th August 1801.</p>

<p>If you have seen either the Hebe or Mendovia, you are acquainted with
the success in Egypt; and, if you have not, the enclosed Gibraltar
Chronicle will inform you of all those particulars: and when we
consider the great disparity of numbers between English and French,
particularly detailed in the Chronicle, we must conclude ourselves
greatly indebted to good fortune for having got well through that very
arduous enterprise.</p>

<p>As the French troops, who capitulated, are nearly double the number
of our people employed on that service, I cannot help having
apprehensions till they are fairly embarked, and we are quit of them;
for it is impossible to trust that scoundrel race if they can reap any
advantage by breaking their faith. I am sorry to find, from several
reports, that our great men don't draw together very well; I mean the
chiefs of our army. It should seem we have more reasons than one to
lament the loss of Sir Ralph Abercrombie,&mdash;the cause of clashing
parties between Scotch and Irish, which is too commonly the case in
our service; and I am afraid something of that sort now and then
arises in the navy. I send you, likewise, our Chronicle of last
Friday, because you will there see the honours that have been paid to
the French officers for the action at Algeziras, as well as the one of
the 13th. You will there perceive that the French Formidable was
attacked by four English ships of war! It is quite wonderful what
improbable lies those rascals do propagate.</p></div>

whose flag he saluted.</p>

<p>The fleet, with the exception of a small squadron off Cadiz, had
returned to Gibraltar on the news that preliminaries of peace were
signed. This was the consequence of the surrender of Alexandria to his
Majesty's arms, and the final expulsion of the French from Egypt; on
which account general rejoicings had taken place. But that which most
strongly excited feelings of joy and exultation in the garrison and
inhabitants of Gibraltar was, the information that his Majesty had
been graciously pleased to honour Sir James Saumarez with the red
riband and star of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath,&mdash;a
distinction which, at this time, was very limited, and conferred only
on those who had highly distinguished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> themselves in battle. There was
then only one class, designated by the letters K.B.; but, in 1815, the
order was, under certain regulations, extended to three classes. The
former Knights of the Bath (K.B.) were made Grand-Crosses, (G.C.B.);
the second, Commanders of the Bath, (K.C.B.); and the third,
Companions of the Bath, (C.B.); by which the value of the original
order has been much depreciated. The honour of knighthood, however, of
whatever description, depends greatly on the brilliancy of the deed
which it is intended to commemorate; and, certainly, on no occasion
has it been destined to perpetuate the memory of a victory more
splendid or more important than that achieved by Sir James. As the
ceremony, both on account of the peculiar circumstances under which it
took place, and the intense interest which Sir James's late actions
had created, was of the most imposing nature, we shall give the reader
the fullest account of it which we have been able to collect.</p>

<p>The regiments and corps will present arms, and the officers salute the
King's commissioner as he comes on the right of each corps
successively. The colours will also salute, and drums beat a march.</p>

<p>As soon as the grenadiers have passed the royal marine artificers, the
latter will form in two lines or four deep, and march in column in
their rear; the 5th regiment will likewise fall in and march in the
rear of the royal marine artificers; and each other corps will in
succession fall in and march to the Grand Parade, where they will form
in a semicircle, the centre of which will be the throne. The diameter
will be occupied by the seamen royal artillery, grenadiers, and
marines.</p>

<p>When the procession has arrived opposite to the centre of the Parade,
it will move down towards the Royal Pavilion; the seamen marching to
the right flank of the diameter, the marines to the left, and the guns
to the left and right of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> seamen and marines, and the grenadiers
on the right and left of the Pavilion.</p>

<p>The music will play "See, the conquering hero comes!" until the
procession arrives opposite to the Royal Pavilion, when they will play
"Rule Britannia." As soon as the knight is seated, the music will play
"God save the King;" and immediately after the ceremony, the
grenadiers will fire a volley, followed by a salute of one round from
the four field-pieces, which will be the signal for a salute, from the
Sea-line Walls, of sixty-three guns, viz. twenty-one guns from the
Saluting Battery, twenty-one from the South Bastion, and twenty-one
from Jumper's Battery and those to the southward. Whilst the salute is
firing, the troops will file off from the Parade, and return to their
former position in the streets; and, after the salute, the procession
will move back to the Convent.</p>

<p>In this manner the procession moved on to the Grand Parade, where, in
front of the Royal Pavilion, a chair of state was raised on three
steps, covered with crimson velvet and rich gold lace. Over the chair
a canopy richly embroidered with gold, and a floor-cloth of the same.
Before this chair, but on the right and left sides, two other chairs
were placed, covered also with crimson velvet and gold lace; over
these were two banners, with the arms of the commissioner upon the
right, and of the knight elect on the left chair. The first division
of the procession having drawn up on the right, the King's
commissioner, the knight elect, the general officers, and their suite
facing to the King's state, and the rear division halting and drawing
up on the left side of the front of the Pavilion, the whole made three
reverences to the King's state, the music playing. Then the ensigns of
the order, and the commission, were laid on the table before the
sovereign's state; at which time General O'Hara and Sir James Saumarez
sat down in their respective chairs, the music playing "God save the
King." The general officers and suite divided, falling back on each
side to leave the front open to the King's chair. After a short pause,
General O'Hara standing up, Sir James Saumarez also rising from his
chair, they both advanced before the table; turned about, and made
three reverences to the King's state. General O'Hara then directed his
secretary to read the King's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> commission. Sir James Saumarez's
secretary attending with a riband, presented it to General O'Hara,
who, as soon as the commission was read, received the riband, with
which he invested Sir James Saumarez; making at the time the following
short speech.</p>

<p>"It is most gratifying to me that, in obeying his Majesty's commands,
I perform this highly honourable duty so near the scene of your heroic
achievements, and before troops who were witnesses of your
distinguished conduct and eminent valour."</p>

<p>To this, Sir James replied in a short complimentary speech suitable to
the occasion.</p>

<p>After the salute, the commissioner and Sir James Saumarez stood up,
and walked to the front of the Pavilion, made three reverences to the
King's state, and the procession returned to the Convent.</p>

<p>The number and martial appearance of the troops; the multitude of
spectators of both sexes, and of all nations and countries, who
crowded the surrounding heights, and the lower part of the mountain
that overlooks the sands; the roar of the cannon from our batteries,
and from the shipping in the bay; the presence of those brave seamen
and marines, so worthy of the gallant chief under whose command they
fought; but, above all, the proximity of Algeziras and the Straits,
and the train of ideas awakened by the sight of those places where the
new knight, but a few months before, had entitled himself to the
honourable tokens of gratitude now bestowed by his King and country;
every circumstance contributed to render this scene one of the most
solemn and most affecting that it may be the lot of men to behold.</p>

<p>Of the knight himself nothing needs be said in this garrison.</p>

<p>The following irregular stanzas on the occasion were written
extempore by an officer of the royal navy.</p>

<p>The salutes from the batteries being returned, the ceremonies
ended and other festivities commenced.</p></div>

<p>Sir Charles Morice Pole being informed by the governor of Cadiz that
the preliminary treaties of peace had been acceded to by Spain, and
that hostilities had ceased between the two nations, proceeded to
England on the 11th of November, leaving the chief command to Sir
James Saumarez; who, pursuant to orders, proceeded to Gibraltar Bay
with the following ships, Cæsar, Dreadnought, Spencer, Vanguard,
Defence, Bellona, Zealous, Warrior, Trial, Powerful, and St. George;
which, besides the four ships belonging to the squadron of Sir John
Warren, were present on this occasion. This formidable squadron having
been replenished with provisions, remained at Gibraltar for further
orders.</p>

<p>On the 27th of November, Lieutenant Wooldridge, of the hired armed
brig Pasley, arrived with her prize the Spanish privateer Rosario,
which he captured, after a gallant action, on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> 30th October, in
which the former had four killed and six wounded, while the latter had
twenty-one killed and thirteen wounded, in a crew of ninety-four
men,&mdash;forty more than the Pasley. Lieutenant Wooldridge, who so
gallantly concluded the hostilities on this station, was, at the
recommendation of Sir James, promoted to the rank of commander.</p>

<p>The next arrival from England brought the gratifying intelligence that
the thanks of both Houses of Parliament had been unanimously voted to
Sir James, and the captains, officers, and crews of his squadron. The
following account is rendered more interesting by the part taken on
this occasion by his late Majesty, then Duke of Clarence, Earl St.
Vincent, and Viscount Nelson, in the House of Lords, and by Mr. Pitt
in the House of Commons.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right"><i>30th October 1801.&mdash;House of Lords.</i></p>

<p>The First Lord of the Admiralty (<i>Earl St. Vincent</i>) rose to move the
thanks of the House to Admiral Sir James Saumarez for his gallant and
spirited conduct in his late actions with the united fleets of France
and Spain, in which he had destroyed two Spanish men-of-war and taken
a ship belonging to France. His lordship, with much feeling, stated
the particulars of the engagement in the Bay of Algeziras, in which,
notwithstanding the loss of one of his Majesty's ships, owing to a
matter which Sir James could not prevent, that meritorious officer
displayed the most dauntless courage and energy: that in the first
engagement the fleet of Sir James was much crippled and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> disabled; but
that, nevertheless, he made such wonderful exertions to repair his
damages, that he was soon afterwards enabled to pursue the French and
Spanish fleets, and to engage them with the most decisive success,
although greatly his superiors in numbers and weight of metal. The
gallant achievement, he declared, surpassed everything he had met with
in his reading or service; and when the news of it arrived, the whole
Board, at which he had the honour to preside, were struck with
astonishment to find that Sir James Saumarez, in so very short a time
after the affair of the Bay of Algeziras, had been able, with a few
ships only, and one of them disabled, especially his own, to come up
with the enemy, and, with unparalleled bravery, to attack them, and
obtain a victory highly honourable to himself, and essentially
conducive to the national glory.</p>

<p>His lordship said, the merit of the brave Admiral spoke so strongly
for itself, that it would be unnecessary for him to take up more of
their lordships' time respecting it. He should also move the thanks of
the House to the captains who served under Sir James; but he could not
forbear to give his highest applause to the captains whose conduct was
so gallant and successful on that day. There was no invidious
distinction in this. Every captain on that service, he was persuaded,
would have done his duty in the same signal manner had he been
fortunate enough to get into action. But it was not less his duty to
notice the conduct of these gallant officers, on whom the fortune of
the day fell, and who contributed to make the event so glorious by
their conduct. Lord St. Vincent then formally moved the thanks of the
House to Rear-admiral Sir James Saumarez.</p>

<p><i>Lord Viscount Nelson</i> immediately rose to support the character and
conduct of Sir James Saumarez, on which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> his noble friend had just
expressed himself in such handsome terms. He said he was under
particular obligations to that gallant officer, who had been second in
command under him in one of his most important and successful
engagements; that in the action in Algeziras Bay he was persuaded Sir
James would have achieved his object, and carried the enemy's ships
into Gibraltar, but for the failure of the wind; an accident which the
Admiral could not prevent, and which enabled the enemy to haul their
ships so close within the shore as to defeat his purpose. Nothing
dismayed or dispirited, however, with the unfortunate event of that
attempt, Sir James made wonderful exertions to put his few ships into
a condition to sail after a fleet of the enemy and to attack them,
though their fleet consisted of ten ships, and Sir James had but five,
and his own ship greatly disabled. The glorious result their lordships
well knew. But he was not surprised at the matchless intrepidity and
skill of his gallant friend when he considered the professional school
in which he had been bred, viz. the late Lord Howe, Lord Hood, Lord
Bridport, and his noble friend the noble earl who sat next him. (Earl
St. Vincent, feeling the full force of the compliment, made the noble
and gallant lord a very low bow.) From such masters he could not but
have learned everything that was courageous, spirited, and
magnanimous. His lordship added some further panegyrics; and, after
apologising to the House for having intruded on the time of their
lordships, concluded by saying it was with the greatest satisfaction
he voted for the thanks of the House to that meritorious officer.</p>

<p><i>Earl St. Vincent</i> next moved the thanks of the House be given to
Captains Hood and Keats, and such of the officers as principally
distinguished themselves in the two engagements in the Bay of
Algeziras and off Gibraltar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> The <i>Duke of Clarence</i> rose, and said he
should have given his testimony in an ample manner, both of the
gallant officer Sir James Saumarez, and the captains who had the good
fortune to be in the action, if the noble lord at the head of the
Admiralty and the hero of the Nile had not been present to do them
greater justice than his praise could afford. He could not, however,
give a silent assent to the motion. He rose now, as a professional
man, to express his entire concurrence with every syllable that had
fallen from his two noble friends in commendation of the gallant Sir
James Saumarez, and to declare the satisfaction he felt in the thanks
of the House being voted, to those brave officers Captain Hood and
Captain Keats, for their distinguished conduct in the two engagements.
They were both as deserving officers as any in his Majesty's service;
but he could speak more particularly to the merit of Captain Keats,
having served under him for four years and a half during a former war
as midshipman in the same watch. He was persuaded, whenever the
country should be engaged in another war, Captain Keats would
eminently distinguish himself.</p>

<p>The motion was agreed to, <i>nemine dissentiente</i>; as were likewise two
other motions, made of course in applause of the men serving in the
fleet of Sir James Saumarez, and to request that gallant Admiral to
communicate the sense the House entertained of the other officers,
seamen, and marines.</p></div>

<p>In the House of Commons Mr. Pitt said he would make a motion in which
he was sure he was anticipated by the expectations of the House and of
the public: it was for the thanks of the House to Rear-admiral Sir
James Saumarez. On the merits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> of the gallant Admiral, and those who
served under him, there could, he was sure, be no difference of
opinion. He was equally sure that there was no difference of opinion
respecting the merit of Sir James Saumarez in the attack which he made
upon the French squadron in Algeziras Bay a few days previously to the
signal advantage which he obtained over the combined squadrons of
France and Spain, and for which he would now, he trusted, receive the
thanks of the House. It was impossible for him, in making this motion,
not to advert to the attack, in which the zeal and ability of the
commander, and the spirit and intrepidity of the officers who served
under him, were so eminently displayed. That attack failed; but the
failure was owing, as Sir James Saumarez stated, to the failure of the
wind and a sudden calm which came on. It was the misfortune of the
gallant Admiral on that day to lose one of the ships under his
command; but the officers and crew of that ship defended her until
they had lost half their numbers. Sir James Saumarez was not
disheartened, as must always be the case with men of true courage and
vigour. He waited for an opportunity to make amends for his failure;
that opportunity offered; and he availed himself in a manner worthy of
him who had been the companion of, and sharer in the glory of, Lords
St. Vincent and Nelson on the 14th of February and in the Bay of
Aboukir. These events were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> still so fresh in the memory of every man
that it would be unnecessary for him to enlarge on them. He should
therefore conclude with moving</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>That the thanks of the House be given to Rear-admiral Sir James
Saumarez, Bart. and Knight of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath,
for his alacrity and zeal in pursuing, and for his able and gallant
conduct in the successful attack on, the combined squadrons of the
enemy in the Straits of Gibraltar on the 12th and 13th days of July
last, by the squadron under his command.</p>

<p>In like manner the thanks of the House were voted to the captains,
officers, seamen, and marines, <i>nemine contradicente</i>; as also that
the Rear-admiral should communicate the same, and that the Speaker do
send the resolutions to Sir James Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>The thanks of the House of Lords were conveyed to Sir James in the
following letter from the Lord Chancellor, dated 30th October 1801:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honour to obey the commands of the House of Lords in

which the discharge of this duty affords me of expressing to a person
to whom the country is so deeply indebted the personal interest and
veneration with which I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="right smcap">Eldon, C.</p></div>

<p>To which Sir James returned the following answer:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">Cæsar, Gibraltar, 6th January 1802.</p>

<p class="smcap">My Lord,</p>

<p>I yesterday had the honour of your lordship's letter, transmitting to
me the resolutions of the House of Lords on the victory obtained by
the squadron under my orders, on the 12th and 13th of July last, at
the entrance of the Straits of Gibraltar.</p>

<p>Having on four occasions been honoured with the thanks of their
lordships when commander of a line-of-battle ship in different general
actions, this very high mark of distinction cannot but be more

<p>I shall have great satisfaction in conveying to the captains,
officers, and men under my orders the vote of the august House,
expressive of the sense their lordships are pleased to entertain of
their general conduct.</p>

<p>To the Right Honourable Lord Eldon,<br />

<p>From the Speaker of the House of Commons Sir James at the same time
received the following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Palace-yard, 31st October 1801.</p>

<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>In obedience to the commands of the House of Commons, I have the
honour of transmitting their vote of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> thanks for your alacrity and
zeal in pursuing, and able and gallant conduct in the successful
attack on, the combined squadron of the enemy in the Straits of
Gibraltar, on the 12th and 13th days of July last, by the squadron
under your orders; and also their thanks to the captains and officers
of that squadron, and their acknowledgment and approbation of the
services of the seamen and marines.</p>

<p>I feel the highest personal satisfaction in transmitting these
resolutions to an officer who has on so many occasions done
distinguished honour to his country, and to a service in which the
nation feels the most important and anxious concern, and in the
character of which I must individually be much interested.</p>

<p class="left50"><br />I have the honour to be,<br />

<p>The next flattering compliment which Sir James received was of a more
substantial nature, and not less honourable, being the thanks of the
lord mayor, aldermen, and commons of London with the freedom of the
city, &amp;c. accompanied by a sword, value one hundred guineas. The
resolutions were conveyed to Sir James in the following letter from

<p>The inhabitants of the channel islands, justly proud of their heroic
countryman, were not behind in acknowledging the high sense they
entertained of his services. The following is a copy of the resolution
of the States of the island of Jersey:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">Aux Etats de l'île de Jersey.</p>

<p>L'an Mil huit cent un, le vingt-deuxième jour d'Août, les Etats, à
leur première tenue depuis la nouvelle de la victoire qu'a remportée
l'Amiral Sir James Saumarez sur la flotte combinée de la France et de
l'Espagne, dans les Passages de Gibraltar, ont un devoir de manifester
la joie et la satisfaction que leur inspire cet heureux événement. Les
divers exploits qui ont signalé les armes de sa Majesté ont toujours
excité la plus vive allégresse dans le c&oelig;ur des habitans de cette
île. Mais ce qui relève infiniment à leurs yeux le prix de cette
dernière victoire est la<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> considération qu'elle est due à un natif de
l'île de Guernesey, à laquelle ce pays se sent étroitement attaché par
les liens d'une commune origine, de la proximité, de l'amitié. Cette
assemblée n'a pu manquer de remarquer les actions éclatantes qui ont
distingué la carrière navale de Sir James Saumarez dans sa qualité de
capitaine. Elle voit enfin que, parvenu au premier rang, il a su y
briller d'un nouveau lustre, et s'y acquérir de nouveaux droits à la
reconnaissance de la patrie. On a surtout admiré l'étonnante célérité
avec laquelle cet amiral a réparé les damages de son escadre après la
sanglante journée d'Algeziras; l'intrépidité avec laquelle il a osé
poursuivre une flotte doublement supérieure par le nombre, la
grandeur, et l'équipement parfait des vaisseaux; la promptitude avec
laquelle il a saisi le moment favorable de l'attaque dans l'obscurité
d'une nuit orageuse; et finalement le succès décisif qui a couronné
ces nobles efforts. Considérant tout ce qu'a d'honorable pour l'île de
Guernesey d'avoir mis au jour un de ces grands hommes qui ont illustré
leur nation en la défendant, et dont la Providence s'est servie pour
réprimer l'insatiable ambition de l'ennemi, les Etats ont unanimement
résolu d'offrir dans cette occasion aux habitans de la dite île leurs
sincères et cordiales félicitations; et, afin de leur faire connaître
la part que prend cette assemblée à cet événement mémorable, le
greffier est chargé de transmettre le présent acte à Robert P. Le
Marchant, écuyer, bailli de Guernesey, pour qu'il veuille bien le
communiquer à ses compatriotes de la manière la plus convenable.</p>

followed by a liberal subscription for the wounded, and the widows and
orphans of those who fell in the actions. Large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> sums were also
subscribed for the same purpose in Great Britain; while the island of
Guernsey presented Sir James with a very handsome silver vase, being
the second time the high sense entertained of his services had been
thus expressed. The inscription on the first vase, which has not been
before given, is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="p2"></p>

<p>Destined to remain with his squadron at Gibraltar, Sir James suffered
a severe disappointment in being prevented from returning home. He
occasionally visited Tetuan; and, after the preliminaries of peace
were signed, he had communication with the Spanish authorities. On the
19th of January he was surprised by the appearance of four French
line-of-battle ships in the eastward, which passed through the Straits
of Gibraltar; on which he wrote a letter to his brother, whence the
following is extracted:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Cæsar, Gibraltar, 20th January 1802.</p>

<p>I had the pleasure yesterday to receive your affectionate letter, by
way of Malaga, which, although of an old date,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> was very acceptable.
The letter it enclosed from our brother Sir Thomas was the first I
have seen from Guernsey for several months. Our accounts from England
extend to the 6th instant, by way of Lisbon. Although no public
despatches have been received, we have reason to expect the next
arrival will bring the news of the definitive treaty being signed; at
the same time it is rather surprising to see the French detaching
ships from all their ports. Yesterday, four sail of the line and a
frigate appeared to the eastward, which unquestionably must be
Gantheaume's squadron. I detached the Phaeton with the intelligence,
and am preparing four ships to follow them to the West Indies, taking
it for granted they are going to St. Domingo.</p>

<p>I enclose a letter for Nicholas, who I hope has arrived before this
time. It is satisfactory to be informed that Ceylon is a healthy
situation. I hope before many years we shall see him amongst us in the
enjoyment of good health and a competent fortune, for few are more
deserving than he is.</p>

<p>Nothing has joined from Lord Keith since my last; but I understand his
lordship is expecting his orders of recall, which will leave me no
chance of going to England for some months. I have no apprehensions of
being ordered to Jamaica; but, if I should, I hope none of my friends
will suffer uneasiness on my account. My chief dislike to the station
would be its prolonging my absence from home, as, in other respects, I
would as soon be there as in any other station whilst I remain
employed.</p>

<p>I am well pleased with the motto ("In Deo spero") you have
substituted. It is the one I had fixed upon before; but wishing to
have reference to the action made me adopt the other, though not
without much consideration, as I allow it appeared as if I no longer
had that<span class="smcap">trust</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> which I hope will never forsake me in any event through
life.</p></div>

<p>On the 21st of January Sir James detached the Warrior, Defence,
Bellona, and Zealous, of 74 guns each, to follow the French squadron
to the West Indies. These ships were placed under the command of
Captain Tyler, of the Warrior, who was senior officer, and had
directions to proceed to Jamaica and join Sir John Duckworth, the then
commander-in-chief on that station: at the same time the Phaeton,
Captain Morris, was despatched to England with the intelligence of the
above circumstances. The Leda, Captain Hope, had been sent to Cadiz to
receive for safety the specie belonging to the merchants, and to
obtain information respecting the movements of the ships in that
harbour. It was then ascertained that the French ship Duquesne, of 80
guns, had arrived there in distress, having parted from a convoy bound
to St. Domingo. She was accompanied by a French frigate; and, both
having troops on board, no doubt could be entertained of their
destination, as well as that of the squadron under Rear-admiral
Gantheaume. Several transports and troop-ships arrived from Malta and
Egypt, having on board part of the army employed on the reduction of
Alexandria, and were despatched to England.</p>

<p>An unexpected event now plunged the garrison of Gibraltar into deep
affliction. The gallant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> and highly-respected governor was seized with
a malignant illness, which terminated his life in five days. With this
mournful intelligence Sir James despatched the Penelope frigate to
England, and another frigate to Lord Keith, at Malta. The following is
a copy of his letter to Mr. Nepean on that occasion:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I request you will be pleased to inform my Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty that I have thought it necessary to despatch the Penelope to
England, in order that the King's ministers may be apprised as
speedily as possible of the loss his Majesty's service has sustained
in the death of Governor O'Hara, who departed this life early this
morning. I cannot on this occasion refrain from expressing my deep
concern at the loss of an officer from whom the naval service in
particular has always experienced the utmost attention.</p>

<p class="left60">I am, sir,<br />
<span class="i1">Your obedient humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right smcap">James Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>General Burnet succeeded, <i>pro tempore</i>, to the command of the
garrison; and Captain Gaskill, the late governor's aide-de-camp, was
the bearer of the despatches to Government. It was about this time
that the 54th regiment, commanded by Colonel Ross, arrived from Egypt
to relieve the Cambrian Rangers, part of which went home in the
Penelope, and the remainder in the Dido, troop-ship.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>The colours were hoisted half-mast on board all the ships until the
3rd of March, when General O'Hara's funeral took place; on which
occasion the boats of the squadron, joined by those of the foreign
men-of-war, rowed in procession to the Ragged Staff, while minute-guns
were fired by the flag-ship and the garrison. The solemnity of this
scene could not but be rendered more impressive by the recollection of
the investiture of Sir James with the Order of the Bath, in which the
venerable and gallant general had performed so distinguished a part
only a short time before.</p>

<p>This event was followed by one of the same mournful description,
namely, the death of Admiral Brenton, father to the gallant captain of
the Cæsar, a venerable and highly-respected officer. As family affairs
required Captain Brenton's presence in England, he exchanged with
Captain Downman, of the Dorothea, by mutual consent, and with
permission from the Admiral. This exchange accordingly took place on
the 17th March 1802, when Captain Downman joined the Cæsar.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of March Sir James received orders from Lord Keith to
proceed with the Cæsar to Minorca, for the purpose of superintending
the various duties that might become necessary on the evacuation of
that island; but as the order was grounded on a report which had
reached his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> lordship from Toulon and Marseilles that the definitive
treaty of peace was signed, which proved to be premature, Sir James
postponed his departure until more authentic information should
arrive, and he acquainted the Lords of the Admiralty of this
circumstance by a letter to the secretary, dated on the following day.
Lord Keith himself, however, arrived in the Foudroyant, from Malta, on
the 26th of March, and, being in expectation of orders to proceed to
England, he did not interfere with the duty of the squadron.</p>

<p>On the 24th of April, there being no doubt that Minorca would soon be
given up to Spain, Sir James received the following orders from Lord
Keith, appointing him to conduct that service:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">By the Right Hon. Lord Keith, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Whereas orders may be immediately expected for the evacuation of the
island of Minorca, and as I think it indispensable that that service
should be conducted by an officer of rank, ability, and experience,
you are hereby required and directed to proceed thither in his
Majesty's ship the Cæsar, to be in readiness to take upon you the
charge and execution of that duty, following such directions in that
behalf as I have already forwarded to the senior officer there, copies
of the most material of which are herewith enclosed, and such other
instructions as you may hereafter receive from me; communicating with
me or with Rear-admiral Sir Richard Bickerton, at Malta, on all
occasions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> when the necessity of the service on which you are employed
may so require.&mdash;Given on board the Foudroyant, Gibraltar, 24th April
1802.</p></div>

<p>The following is a copy of the orders alluded to:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In the event of orders being received by you over land, or the arrival
of instructions by sea which may not have reached me, for the
evacuation of the island of Minorca, you are hereby specially
instructed to carry them into effect in the manner most consistent
with the directions which you shall receive. You will enter into
immediate communication with the officer commanding his Majesty's land
forces, and co-operate with him on all necessary occasions for
carrying the evacuation into effect; and you will furnish to him, and
to other officers of rank and their families, the best accommodation
of which the disposable room in the ships will admit. In such case it
will be incumbent on you to obtain, without a moment's loss of time,
an exact estimate of the tonnage that will be required as well for the
embarkation of the troops as of the stores, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>The above will be sufficient to show the arduous duty Sir James had to
perform. The number of troops to be embarked at Minorca was 5,247; at
Malta, 6,529; at Elba, 418; and at Egypt, 4,631; in all, 16,845. These
were destined partly to England, and partly to Ireland; to transport
which, men-of-war and merchant-ships were collected from all quarters.</p>

<p>On the same day Sir James received from Lord Keith a copy of a letter
from the secretary of the Admiralty, dated 1st April 1802:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>I transmit to your lordship herewith, by command of my Lords
Commissioners of the Admiralty, for your information, a Gazette
Extraordinary, containing an account of the signature of the
definitive treaty of peace at Amiens, on the 27th of last month, by
the Plenipotentiary of his Majesty, and the Plenipotentiaries of
France, and Spain, and the Batavian Republic. If no unforeseen event
should happen, their lordships think it probable that the ratification
will be exchanged in the course of three weeks from this time; but,
whenever it shall take place, the earliest notice thereof shall be
given to your lordship, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>The same despatch brought information that his Royal Highness the Duke
of Kent (father of her present most excellent Majesty) had been
appointed governor of Gibraltar; and, in consequence, the following
orders were issued by Lord Keith:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Foudroyant, Gibraltar, 28th April 1802.</p>

<p>General Memorandum.</p>

<p>When his Royal Highness the Duke of Kent, who is expected at
Gibraltar, arrives in this bay, the flag-officers and captains then at
the anchorage are to attend in their boats with their flags and
pendants hoisted, and to row in succession, the flag-officer or
officers following the commander-in-chief, and the captains next, two
by two, according to seniority; and, as soon as his Royal Highness
shall have landed, the officers are at liberty to return to their
ships.</p>

<p>When the royal standard is hoisted in the boat in which the Prince is
to land, the ship he came in is to fire twenty-one guns; and, as the
boat passes the flag-ship, twenty-one guns shall be fired from all the
ships commanded by post-captains,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> beginning when the Foudroyant shall
have fired her second gun; the guards to be turned out, and the drums
to beat a march, but the ships' yards are not to be manned.&mdash;By order
of the commander-in-chief.</p></div>

<p>We need scarcely add that his Royal Highness was received with every
mark of respect due to his illustrious name, and to the high situation
in which he had been placed.</p>

<p>The Cæsar sailed from Gibraltar about the 1st of May, and on the 6th
arrived at Mahon. When Sir James entered upon his important mission,
he communicated immediately with General Clephane on the subject of
the evacuation of the island of Minorca; and measures were taken for
the embarkation of the troops and stores as soon as the ratification
of the treaty of peace arrived, which took place on the 17th of May.
Sir James at the same time received the welcome information that he
was, with the Cæsar, to carry the last division to England. It was
determined to send the Dreadnought and Généreux with the first
division of transports, consisting of ten sail, in which were the 79th
regiment and ordnance-stores, under command of Captain Cornwall
Berkeley, of the Généreux. These were to proceed to Gibraltar; but the
Dreadnought, Captain Vashon, had orders to proceed direct to England
with the second battalion of the 40th regiment, which was embarked in
that ship at the same time the troops at Porto Ferrajo and Elba
sailed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> on the 2nd of June. Some of the transports having returned
from Gibraltar, the embarkation continued, and the island was finally
given up on the 16th June. The orders given on this occasion, will be
perused with interest.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Copy of articles agreed upon between Rear-admiral Sir James Saumarez
and General Clephane, for the evacuation of the island of Minorca, and
for delivering it to the authorities of his Catholic Majesty the King
of Spain.</p>

<p>Rear-admiral Sir James Saumarez, Bart, and K.B., Commanding his
Britannic Majesty's squadron in the port of Mahon, and Major-general
William Douglas Maclean Clephane, commanding the troops upon the
island of Minorca, being duly authorised on the part of his Britannic
Majesty by his royal sign manual, and Don Juan Miguel de Nines y
Felia, &amp;c. having communicated his power and authority to receive
the same, have agreed to the following arrangements, viz.</p>

<p>1st. Brigadier-general Moncreiffe is appointed to arrange with his
Excellency the Captain-general, &amp;c. &amp;c. the speediest time for
admitting his Catholic Majesty's troops by the gate at Ciudadela, and
the troops of his Britannic Majesty will evacuate at the same time by
the gate of Mahon.</p>

<p>2nd. On the following day Major-general Clephane will be ready to
receive his Excellency the Captain-general upon the glacis of Fort
George, and deliver the keys thereof in due form; immediately after
which the British troops will embark.</p>

<p>3rd. The fort of Fornells, and the towers on the coast, will be given
up in due time to the engineer, Don Raman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>4th. Captain Framingham, Royal Artillery, will deliver up the ordnance and the ammunition found
on the island at the time of the capture thereof as nearly as
possible, and now collected at the following places, viz. Fornells,
Buffera, Adaya, and Fort George.</p>

<p>5th. The royal arsenal shall be given up in its present state. Two
line-of-battle ships' lower-masts and bowsprits, British property,
will be left in store until means be furnished by the British
Government to remove them.</p>

<p>6th. The papers found in the secretary's office will be restored.</p>

<p>7th. The revenues of the island are to belong to his Catholic Majesty
from the 23rd day of May last, that being the day appointed by the
definitive treaty for the cession of the island. In consequence of the
judge and other civil officers having been employed by the British
Government, their salaries have been paid up to the 17th June.</p>

<hr class="c15" />
<p class="right">Cæsar, off Port Mahon, 16th June 1802.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I beg to acquaint you, for the information of my Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty, that the island of Minorca has been this day given
up to the Spanish Government; and Major-general Clephane, with the
last division of troops, embarked immediately after having put them in
possession of Fort George. I shall proceed with all despatch to
Gibraltar with his Majesty's ship Cæsar, and the Pomone, and Port
Mahon brig; and have detached the Camelion to Barcelona, to land
Major-general Clephane's and my despatches.</p>

<p>I have detached to the island of Malta 3,250 tonnage of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> transports
not required for the services of this island; and I have given
directions to Captain Bowen, of his Majesty's troop-ship Alligator, to
remain in Mahon harbour ten days from the time of the embarkation, and
then proceed for Malta, and follow the orders of Rear-admiral Sir
Richard Bickerton.</p>

<p>I herewith have the honour to enclose, for their lordships'
information, a copy of the articles agreed upon with his Excellency
Don Juan Miguel de Nines y Felia, the Spanish Captain-general; and I
have the satisfaction to observe that the utmost good order and
harmony has prevailed between the forces of our respective nations.</p>

<p>I have the further satisfaction to inform their lordships that, during
the arduous service of embarking the numerous stores from Minorca, in
which the seamen of the ships of war and transports have borne a
considerable share, there has not been the smallest cause of complaint
of any irregularity whatever having been committed.</p>

<p>Enclosed is a return of troop-ships and transports destined for
Ireland, which embarked the last division of troops.</p>

<p>Major-general Clephane takes his passage to England on board the
Pomone. I have to express my acknowledgments to that officer for the
alacrity with which the embarkation of the various stores from the
different ports of the island has been effected.</p>

<p class="left60">I am, sir,<br />
<span class="i1">Your most obedient humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right smcap">James Saumarez.</p>

<p>To Evan Nepean, Esq.</p>
<hr class="c15" />
<p>By the Right Honourable Lord Keith, K.B. Admiral of the Blue, and
Commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>Whereas I have obtained permission from the Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty to return to England, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> have been authorised by their
lordships to leave such directions for the governance of the station
till their further commands are ascertained as I shall judge fit and
proper for the execution of the Board; you are hereby required and
directed, after my departure, to regulate the service in this bay, and
pay attention to the instructions that follow, viz.&mdash;You will, on all
proper and necessary occasions, communicate with his Royal Highness
the Duke of Kent, governor of this garrison, and in particular yield
all the accommodation of which ships passing from Minorca or Elba can
admit for the reception of parties of the 5th regiment of foot, which
are ordered to return to Britain from hence.</p>

<p>When the Acasta returns from Malta, she is not to be detained, the
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty having expressly directed her
return; and, as she will be able to accommodate a considerable number
of men, I recommend that she receive part of the 5th regiment; and
also; the Diane and Carriere, if they arrive here, and that you
forthwith direct them to proceed.</p>

<p>Captain Dundas, of the Solebay, has my orders to repair to Lisbon to
receive for Britain part of the troops who are there; and the
accompanying order, addressed to Captain Hope, directs him to proceed
with the Leda on the same; service. Captain Beanes, of the Determinée,
and Captain Provost, of the Bonne Citoyenne, are instructed to proceed
to Britain forthwith.</p>

<p>You will order the Milbrook to Lisbon with the letters from hence by
the next Levant wind, and from thence to Spithead. The Pigmy will
return to you with the first English mail that arrives in the Tagus.</p>

<p>You will inform yourself, from the officers of the yard, of the
quantity and species of stores that they may be desirous of sending
home; and direct them to be embarked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> in his Majesty's ships and
transports that are returning, in such proportions as can be
conveniently received.</p>

<p>You will allow no ships to sail for Great Britain with more than six
weeks' provision on board, till the agent victuallers shall be
provided with a sufficient supply for the ships that remain here.</p>

<p>All transports, victuallers, and other vessels arriving here on the
public account, are to be cleared with the greatest despatch; and, if
any unnecessary delay appears on the master's part, you will cause
protest to be made, and acquaint the transport board thereof.</p>

<p>As it is probable that Rear-admiral Sir Richard Bickerton may send
down troop-ships to this place for the removal of the 5th regiment of
foot, and as some part of the regiment is already embarked, and more
of them may be forwarded by other opportunities, of which you may be
able to avail yourself; it is my direction that such troop-ships, when
they arrive, as they are not wanted for the conveyance of the 5th
regiment, may be either returned to Malta or sent to Lisbon for the
embarkation of troops under the command of Lieutenant-general Fraser,
as existing circumstances may recommend as the most needful to be
done. You will take care that no ships pass without having as many men
as they can receive; and you will have the means of completing them by
separate embarkations of the regiment above-mentioned, observing that
the destination is the same; and, for your better guidance in this
particular, I enclose herewith a state of the troop-ships, with the
freights and the destinations appointed for them.</p>

<p>Till special orders are received from the Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty, the ships and vessels, as per list enclosed, are to remain
upon the service of the station; and if any of them arrive with
contrary instructions from Rear-admiral Sir Richard Bickerton, or Sir
James Saumarez,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> before that was known, you are to retain them here
accordingly.</p>

<p>You will open all public despatches which may be addressed to me, and
carry them, as far as depends upon you, into effect at this place.
Such as are addressed to Rear-admiral Sir Richard Bickerton you will
forward to him at Malta. Maintain a correspondence with him, as the
officer charged with the chief command on the station, by all
convenient opportunities, and follow such orders and directions as you
may receive from him.</p>

<p>No duty on which Sir James was ever employed was executed with more
address, or more completely to the general satisfaction. The honour of
the British flag was maintained in a manner which could not be
questioned, being borne away mounted on a cannon, on which it was
embarked without the necessity of striking it, when the keys of the
fortress were delivered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> to the Spanish commander-in-chief, while the
Spanish standard was hoisted at the flag-staff. The greatest decorum
was preserved on both sides.</p>

<p>The Cæsar left Mahon on the 17th June, with the last division of the
troops, and arrived at Gibraltar on the 24th, when Sir James found
that Lord Keith had already sailed, leaving orders for him to follow
to England with the last division, which consisted of three sail of
the line and six troop-ships.</p>

<p>After exchanging complimentary letters with his Excellency the
Captain-general and Governor of Andalusia, Sir James took leave of his
Royal Highness the Governor of Gibraltar. He sailed on the 30th of
June, anchored at Spithead on the 23rd of July 1802, and reported in
the usual manner the arrival of the Cæsar to the Admiralty.</p>

<p>Hostilities with France were about to be resumed early in the year
1803, and Sir James was called into active service. On the 11th of
March he hoisted his flag at Sheerness, on board the Zealand, in order
to expedite the preparations that were going on in the Medway. Soon
after this, the Zealand went to the Nore. She was at that time
commanded by Captain, afterwards Admiral, William Mitchell, an officer
who had risen to the rank of Rear-admiral by his good conduct, after
having been flogged through the fleet for desertion.</p>

<p>The great preparations now making at St. Maloes rendered it probable
that the intention of Bonaparte<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> was to attack the Channel Islands;
Sir James was therefore appointed to the command at Guernsey, and,
proceeding from the Nore in the Kite brig, he fell in with the
Grampus, which was destined, <i>pro tempore</i>, for his flag. Both ships
arrived at St. Pierre's roads on the 19th of May. Here the Admiral's
squadron consisted of six frigates, and six brigs and cutters, which
were chiefly employed in blockading the adjacent coast, and in
preventing the concentration of the enemy's force at St. Maloes and
Granville, the two principal places whence it appeared an attack would
be made.</p>

<p>The Grampus was commanded by Captain Thomas Gordon Caulfield, who had
notions of discipline peculiar to himself, with which Sir James, who
lived on shore with his family, did not interfere. The following
anecdote will serve to show that these deviations from the laws and
customs of the navy are seldom attended with success.</p>

<p>It was Captain Caulfield's positive instructions that no boatswain's
mate, or other petty officer, should carry a cane, the usual emblem of
their authority; and that he would not punish any man unless convicted
by the testimony of two witnesses, while the man himself might bring
others to contradict the assertion of the officer making the
complaint: in short, that the single testimony of an officer could not
be taken without a majority of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> evidence in its support. The ship had
just been manned by impressed seamen, and her complement was completed
from the prisons: it may therefore be supposed, that these regulations
were not calculated to bring the ship speedily into a state of
discipline. It must be remembered that the captain had not the power
of administering an oath, and, when a complaint was made, men were
soon found who would come forward, and prove, according to this
system, that the accusation was groundless; and thus the culprit
always escaped. The ship accordingly fell into a complete state of
insubordination.</p>

<p>On one occasion a man was brought up on the quarter-deck in a state of
intoxication, when the captain, as if he could not believe his own
eyes, thought it necessary to call two of the officers as witnesses.
The man was put into confinement; and next morning, at eight, he was
brought up to be punished at the gangway. The offender being tied up,
and the article of war under which he had fallen being read, the
captain took the opportunity of assuring his assembled crew, that when
<i>legally</i> convicted they were sure of punishment; but that no man
should be struck.</p>

<p>At this moment the sentinel on the forecastle called out that "a prize
was driving towards the ship." The danger of collision was the more
imminent, inasmuch as a heavy gale was blowing at the time. The
master, who sprang forward,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> called aloud, "Veer away the small
bower-cable, or she will be on board of us!" The pause which had been
made in the captain's speech was broken by orders from him to veer
away the cable <i>quickly</i>. "Down, my lads, veer away!" was repeated by
every officer; but the men, not aware of the fatal consequence, and
knowing that they could not, after what the captain said, be
<i>started</i>, moved very leisurely to perform the duty, which, to save
the ship, it was absolutely necessary should be done with the utmost
alacrity. Meanwhile, Captain Caulfield, looking over the back of the
culprit, and viewing the supineness of the men, who were totally
regardless of his repeated injunctions to veer the cable <i>quickly</i>,
began to be indignant; and when the master repeated, "If you do not
veer away at once, we shall lose the bowsprit and all the masts," he
called to the officers in the waist "to start the rascals down to the
cable:" but, as it may be supposed, their unarmed endeavours would not
have been successful, had he not, as the crisis approached, jumped
down himself among the men, and, with the end of the thickest rope he
could find, become the transgressor of his own laws, of the absurdity
of which he was now so fully convinced, that he acknowledged he was
wrong, and completely reversed his system.</p>

<p>No ship ever had a more narrow escape of being wrecked; the prize
drifted so close to the Grampus as to carry away her spritsail yard,
and, drifting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> on the rocks, about three cables' length astern, was
totally lost, and every man perished, among whom were a midshipman and
four of the Grampus's crew. Had the prize, which was a large Dutch
ship, came athwart-hawse of the Grampus, both, instead of one, would
have been wrecked. No alternative was therefore left to Captain
Caulfield but the rope's end, which he employed in violation of his
own rules of discipline.</p>

<p>Sir James was extremely averse to innovations of this kind, and he
took occasion to point out the propriety of officers being supported
in the execution of their duty, and the danger of interfering with the
excellent laws enacted for the government of the navy.</p>

<p>In the Grampus, Sir James visited the island of Jersey, and, after
cruising to examine the coast of France adjacent to the islands, he
returned to Guernsey; soon after which, the Grampus, being a new ship,
was selected to convoy the East India fleet, and was relieved by the
Diomede of fifty guns, Captain Thomas Larcom, on board which ship the
flag was shifted, on the 19th of June, 1803.</p>

<p>As the summer advanced, the preparations of the enemy became more
formidable, and the island was minutely examined by Sir James. The
following anecdote may serve to prove how much officers may be
mistaken as to the natural defences of a sea-coast.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>Some differences of opinion having arisen respecting the possibility
of the enemy landing on the south side of Guernsey, where the land is
high, it was proposed to put the question to the test by actual
experiment. Sir James, and the Governor (Sir John Doyle), accordingly
proceeded to the spot with the boats of the squadron. On arriving at
the alleged inaccessible position, Sir James proposed that the seamen
should be landed, and ordered to ascend what appeared to be a
precipice; when, to the astonishment of the General, the whole body of
men mounted to the top with apparent ease: it was consequently found
advisable to fortify that, as well as other points which had been
before deemed unnecessary.</p>

<p>About this time (3rd of July) the Minerve, Captain Brenton, one of Sir
James's squadron, stationed off Cherbourgh, got aground in a fog, from
a mistake of the pilot, and, after a gallant resistance, was taken by
the enemy. The account of this unfortunate circumstance is so fully
detailed in Captain E.P. Brenton's work, that it need only be
mentioned here as having given great concern to the Admiral, who had
the highest regard for his former companion in arms.</p>

<p>A considerable flotilla of armed vessels, destined for the invasion
either of the Channel Islands or of England, had assembled at
Granville; and Sir James, having shifted his flag from the Diomede to
the Cerberus of thirty-two guns, Captain W.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> Selby, sailed with a
small squadron, consisting of the Charwell, eighteen, Captain Phil.
Dumaresq; the Kite, eighteen, Captain Philip Pipon; the Terror and
Sulphur bombs, Captains M<sup>c</sup>Leod and Hardinge; Esling, Lieutenant
Archbold; and Carteret, Lieutenant Burgess.</p>

<p>On the 14th September, the frigate having anchored as near as the tide
would admit, and the other ships taking their stations, the
bombardment began on the harbour of Granville, and lasted from eleven
till five in the afternoon. On the 15th another attack of the same
kind was made with more effect, as will be seen by the following
official letter to the Secretary of the Admiralty, dated</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Cerberus, off Granville, 15th Sept. 1803.</p>

<p>I beg you will be pleased to inform my Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty, that, having been joined by the Terror bomb on the 8th
instant, and the Sulphur on the 12th, I embarked on board the
Cerberus, and sailed from Guernsey roads the following morning, with
the Charwell and Carteret cutters in company.</p>

<p>It blowing a strong breeze from the eastward, it was not until Tuesday
evening I was enabled to get off Granville; when, having had an
opportunity to reconnoitre the enemy's gun-vessels and other craft
within the pier, and the different batteries by which they were
protected, I anchored the Cerberus as near the shore as the tide would
admit, having only sixteen feet at low-water. At eleven, the Terror
came up, but, having grounded, it was not until two o'clock that
Captain Hardinge was able to place his ship in the position assigned;
this he now did in a most judicious manner,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> and opened a brisk fire
from his two mortars; which was returned from the mortar and
gun-batteries on the heights near the town, and also from some guns on
the pier, and the gun-vessels placed in the entrance.</p>

<p>From the number of well-directed shells thrown from the Terror into
the pier and parts of the town, I am persuaded they must have done
very considerable damage. The fire was kept up till after five
o'clock, when I thought it advisable to recall the Terror, and
anchored with this ship and the Charwell a short distance from the
town. The Sulphur bomb, whose bad sailing prevented her from beating
up, joined shortly after, and also anchored. The loss on this occasion
was two men wounded by splinters on board the Terror.</p>

<p>A few shells were thrown in the evening, but the tide prevented the
ship getting sufficiently near to be attended with much effect.</p>

<p>This morning the squadron was under sail before dawn of day, and all
circumstances concurred to enable them to take their respective
stations with the utmost precision. The two mortar-vessels opened a
brisk and well-directed fire soon after five o'clock; which was
unremittingly kept up till half-past ten, when the falling tide
rendered it necessary to withdraw from the attack. Twenty-two
gun-vessels, that had hauled out of the pier, drew up a regular line,
and kept up a heavy fire, jointly with the batteries around the port,
without doing much execution.</p>

<p>The Cerberus, after getting under sail, grounded on one of the
sand-banks, and remained about three hours, before she floated: nine
of the gun-boats, perceiving her situation, endeavoured to annoy her,
and kept up a heavy fire upon her for some time; but were silenced by
the Charwell and Kite, and also by the fire of the Sulphur and Terror
bombs, and by the carronade launch of the Cerberus, under the orders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
of Lieutenant Mansell, assisted by the Eling and Carteret, which
obliged them to take shelter in their port.</p>

<p>In the performance of this intricate service, I cannot too highly
applaud the zeal and persevering exertions of all the officers and men
under my orders; and I should not do justice to the merits of Captain
Selby, were I not to acknowledge the able assistance I have received
from him since I had the honour of being in his ship: the steadiness
and good conduct of all the officers and men in the Cerberus, during
the time the ship was aground, do them infinite credit. The various
services in which Capt. M<sup>c</sup>Leod of the Sulphur, and Hardinge of the
Terror, have been employed this war, are already sufficiently known:
but I will venture to assert, that in no instance can they have
displayed greater zeal and gallantry than on the present occasion.
Great praise is due to Lieutenants Macartney and Smith, and the
parties of artillery embarked on board the respective bomb-vessels.</p>

<p>It is not possible to ascertain the damages the enemy has sustained;
but, as a very few of the shells missed taking effect, they must have
been very considerable.</p>

<p class="right smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>During the period the Cerberus was aground the tide fell six feet, and
at one time she was in the greatest danger of upsetting; the topmasts
were immediately struck, and the vessel shored up by the lower yards
and spare spars. While heeling over more than forty-five degrees, the
bottom of the ship was exposed to the shot of the enemy, and was
struck in several places. Sir James himself had a very narrow escape
from a shot, which grazed his legs as he was standing on the gangway<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
with the purser and the secretary, whose dismay and quick retreat from
so dangerous a situation only produced a smile from the Admiral, who
would not listen to proposals subsequently made to him for quitting
the Cerberus while in that situation. The coolness with which he gave
his orders, and his presence of mind on this trying occasion, tended
materially to save the ship, by exciting the officers and men to exert
themselves; while the most perfect order was maintained under
circumstances which often cause disorder and confusion.</p>

<p>The Cerberus received no material damage in the bottom from being
aground: she was soon repaired, and returned with the squadron to
Guernsey on the 17th, when the flag was again hoisted in the Diomede.</p>

<p>We subsequently learned that the flotilla at Granville was so much
damaged as to delay its arrival at Boulogne, which was its ultimate
destination, until a late period of the year; and that many of the
vessels were lost in and near the Race of Alderney, on their passage,
by a storm in which they were overtaken.</p>

<p>The following is extracted from a letter which Sir James wrote to his
brother, describing this action:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Cerberus, off Granville, 15th Sept. 1803.</p>

<p>You will be glad to find that, thanks to Providence, the business of
Granville has gone off as well as possible, although we have not
succeeded in entirely destroying the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> enemy's gun-vessels. I have to
regret that, in the execution of my orders, many of the harmless
inhabitants of the town, and their dwellings, must have suffered very
considerably; having bombarded it nearly four hours on Wednesday, and
six hours this morning, with scarcely any intermission.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> This ship
(the Cerberus) was for three hours on shore, and the tide left her six
feet less than she drew. She was at the same time assailed by some of
the enemy's gun-boats, but without great mischief. A shot was very
nearly taking off both Mr. Champion and myself: how our legs escaped
is inconceivable, having come through the part of the quarter-deck
close to which we were standing.</p>

<p>Our friends Dumaresq and Pipon were in company, the former having
joined early this morning. I am quite exhausted with fatigue, having
had no rest since I left the island. Lady S. was unapprised of what
was going forward, as well as yourself; but you must approve of the
motives which urged me to conceal it from you. I am on my return to
the island, which I hope to reach to-morrow evening.</p></div>

<p>The blockade of the French coast between Havre-de-Grace and Ushant,
which was intrusted to Sir James, was kept up with rigour; and the
Channel islands put into such a state of defence, as to defy all the
projects of the enemy. In the performance of this service, the Admiral
had to regret the loss of the Shannon, which was wrecked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> on the 10th
December in a gale, under the batteries of Cape La Hogue; and of the
Grappler, which was lost on the 31st, at the Isles de Choisey: the
crews of both these vessels were saved, but made prisoners.</p>

<p>The Diomede was sent to refit at Portsmouth; and, at the end of 1803,
Sir James's flag was flying on board the Cerberus, while he lived at
his own residence on shore with his family, carrying on the duty as a
port-admiral.</p>

<p class="p2"></p>

<p>The year 1804 is remarkable in the annals of the empire for the
extraordinary exertions made by the First Consul of France to collect
a powerful flotilla at the ports between Flushing, Cherbourg, and
Boulogne, with the avowed intention of invading England. The vessels
so collected were intended to convey the "Army of England," as it was
called by Bonaparte, across the channel. We have already mentioned the
fate of the Granville flotilla, after the attack made on it by Sir
James. Early in this year it was discovered that one of the vessels
belonging to it, a brig of 200 tons, had been driven on shore in the
Bay of Dillette, adjacent to Alderney; that the enemy had succeeded in
drawing her up to repair, and that she was nearly ready for launching.
The commander of the Carteret cutter, who first discovered this,
having represented it to Captain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> Bennet of the Tribune, (senior
officer of the detachment which Sir James had placed off Cherbourg,)
proposed to take advantage of the first nocturnal spring-tide, either
to launch her, if ready, or to destroy her. The Carteret was
accordingly reinforced by two midshipmen and ten men from the Tribune;
a landing was effected, and the guard defeated: but the brig was found
to have a plank out on each side of the keel, and she was therefore
destroyed. This service was performed with the loss of one of the
Carteret's men, Mr. Parker (a midshipman), and two men of the Tribune;
while the enemy's loss was five killed and ten prisoners, who were
afterwards released.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The Diomede, of fifty guns, having been refitted at Portsmouth,
returned to take Sir James's flag. Her former commander, Captain
Thomas Larcom, died at Portsmouth; and Captain Hugh Downman, who had
succeeded Captain Brenton in the Cæsar, was, at Sir James's request,
appointed his flag-captain. The Cerberus was sent to refit at
Portsmouth, and on her way thither she captured a gun-boat.</p>

<p>During the years 1804 and 1805 the following vessels were taken and
destroyed by the squadron:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>&mdash;&mdash; April.&mdash;The Sylph destroyed several gun-vessels in the
Race of Alderney, in which she had one man killed and two wounded.</p>

<p>The Hydra captured a privateer off Cherbourg.</p>

<p>On the 9th October, the Albicore, Captain Henniker, destroyed five
French gun-vessels near Grosnez de Flamanville, without any loss in
men, although considerably damaged in the rigging and hull.</p></div>

<p>In the course of this eventful year, Sir James kept up a constant
correspondence with his friend Lord Nelson, whose glorious career was
now near its close. Availing himself of the opportunity of a vessel
from Guernsey bound to Gibraltar, he sent his lordship a supply of
wines and other good things which that fertile island produces,
together with newspapers, &amp;c. These reached the Victory only a few
days before the memorable battle of Trafalgar; and Lord Nelson's
answer, which we here transcribe, was dated only three days before the
action, and is probably the last but one ever written by him.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Victory, off Cadiz, Oct. 18th, 1805.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Sir James,</p>

<p>You may rely upon it that, when I can, I will remove Lieutenant Fisher
of the R.M. into a frigate; at present, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> fear the frigates are full,
and the line-of-battle ships empty: but in whatever manner, my dear
Sir James, I may be able to meet your wishes, I desire you will let me
know. Our friends at Cadiz are ready to come forth, and I hope they
will not again escape me: the career of the Rochfort squadron, I
think, has been several days stopped by Sir Richard Strachan, but I
wish his force had been more equal to the contest. I have to thank you
for your great attention about my wine, and for recommending me some
excellent champagne. I beg my most respectful compliments to Lady
Saumarez; and, believe me ever, my dear Sir James, your most faithful
and obliged friend,</p>

<p class="right smcap">Nelson &amp; Bronte.</p>
<hr class="c15" />

<p>To Sir James Saumarez, Bart. &amp; K.B.</p>

<p>Since writing my letter, I have to thank you for your packet of
newspapers and your letter of October 1st; nothing could possibly be
more acceptable. I hope we shall see Bonaparte <i>humbled</i>. The Guernsey
vessel has made a very valuable recapture of a vessel loaded with
cloths, bound to Lisbon.</p>

<p class="left70">Your's faithfully,</p>
<p class="right smcap">Nelson &amp; Bronte.</p></div>

<p>The above was probably finished on the 19th, the day on which the
Penelope frigate left the fleet with despatches for England,&mdash;the last
his lordship ever sent.</p>

<p>During the year 1805 Sir James continued in the command at Guernsey,
having his flag in the Diomede, and occasionally on board a frigate in
her absence. The preparations of the French for invasion, which were
continued with unremitting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> vigour, made this station of more
importance than it would otherwise have been. Spain, having declared
war early in January, joined Napoleon in the grand object of invading
England; and it was calculated, including the Dutch fleet, that the
united force, which could be ready in the month of April, would amount
to seventy-five sail of the line, fifty frigates, and 2,300 smaller
vessels; and that the invading army would consist of 200,000 men.</p>

<p>It was evident that, without a junction of all his naval forces in the
British Channel, Napoleon had no chance of being able to make a
descent on the adjacent coast; and, to effect this, it was necessary
to draw off a part of our blockading fleets. With this view the Toulon
fleet went to the West Indies, whither it was pursued by Nelson; and,
after an action with the squadron under Sir Robert Calder, it entered
the port of Cadiz. The effectual blockade of that port and of Brest,
together with the interruptions his flotilla met with in its progress
towards Boulogne, defeated Napoleon's plans; and the Channel islands,
which were now in a complete state of defence, continued unmolested.
The only losses on this station were the capture of two gun-brigs,
after a very gallant defence, by a flotilla of very superior force,
off Granville; and the Pigmy cutter, which was wrecked near Jersey.</p>

<p>The memorable battle of Trafalgar at once put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> an end to all the
speculations of the ruler of France. The projected invasion was now
impossible; and, consequently, the force which had been requisite for
the station Sir James occupied, was no longer necessary. The Diomede,
of fifty guns, and several other vessels, were withdrawn, and Sir
James shifted his flag to the Inconstant. The year 1805 terminated
without any other remarkable occurrence.</p>

<p>During the year 1806 the enemy's convoys were proceeding in a westerly
direction; the victualling the French fleet at Brest, which had
considerably increased, being the principal object, the squadron under
Sir James was actively employed in intercepting these convoys. On the
9th of September the Constance, Captain Burrowes, fell in with Le
Salamandre, French frigate store-ship, of twenty-six guns; and,
assisted by the Strenuous and Sharpshooter, drove her on shore under a
battery; and, believing her destroyed, returned to Jersey. It was,
however, ascertained that she was floated off; and, returning to St.
Maloes, repaired her damages. On the 12th of October, when again
attempting to make her passage, she was attacked by the Constance,
Sheldrake, and Strenuous, and having taken shelter under the fort of
Equi, in the Bay of Brehat, the engagement, in which the gallant
Captain Burrowes was killed, became severe. Le Salamandre, after
running on shore, was compelled to strike, and was taken: but the
wind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> began to blow hard directly on the land; the Constance parted
her cables, which had been damaged by the shot from the batteries, and
drove on shore. It became therefore necessary, after taking out the
men, to burn both the Constance and the prize. In this affair ten men
were killed, and twenty-three wounded, exclusive of thirty-six men
made prisoners in the unsuccessful attempt to save the Constance. The
captain (M. Saloman) of the Salamandre and twenty-nine men were
killed; but of the wounded there is no account, excepting of nine, who
were among the prisoners taken on board the Sheldrake. Captain
Thicknesse, of that sloop, was made post-captain on this occasion.</p>

<p>Nothing else worthy remark, connected with the subject of this memoir,
happened during the year 1806: and Sir James had now enjoyed the
society of his family and friends at his native island for three
years; during which time his mind was not only actively employed in
the performance of his duty as commander-in-chief on this important
station, and in rendering his native island more capable of defence,
but also in the establishment and support of its charitable
institutions.</p>

<p class="p2"></p>

<p>Early in the year 1807 Sir James was called into more active service.
The enemy's fleet at Brest had again become formidable. Earl St.
Vincent was appointed to command the Channel fleet, and immediately
applied for Sir James to be second in command. To make him eligible
for this, he was promoted to the rank of Vice-admiral; and on the 7th
of January he received orders to hoist his flag, blue at the fore, on
board the San Josef, of 112 guns. As the noble Earl was unable from
ill health to keep the sea in the Hibernia, his flag-ship, the whole
responsibility fell on Sir James.</p>

<p>The San Josef, one of the finest ships in the navy, had been taken in
the battle of the 14th<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> of February 1797; and, having since that
period been almost constantly employed, was in need of a thorough
repair. In February she became so leaky, that Sir James was obliged to
shift his flag into the Prince of Wales, Captain Bedford, and send the
San Josef into Plymouth to be repaired; and, it being ascertained that
it would take more than a year before she could be ready, the officers
and men were turned over to the Ville de Paris, which was ordered to
fit for his flag.</p>

<p>Sir James's activity in blockading the enemy was unremitting. The
fleet consisted of twenty-seven sail of the line, nine of which were
three-deckers. It was his custom, every day that the weather
permitted, to stand towards the Black Rocks in a line of battle, and
off in a line of bearing, always communicating with the in-shore
squadron.</p>

<p>On one occasion, while the weather had been thick for several days,
the signal was made from the Hibernia for the enemy's fleet to
leeward. The English fleet bore up in chase; and, although the Prince
of Wales was the worst-sailing ship in the fleet, by carrying a great
press of sail she became the headmost. The wind was from the west, and
the fleet was standing in for Brest, the French coast being a lee
shore. Captain Bedford, who was not so well acquainted with the coast
as Sir James, represented the danger that the fleet was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> running into,
as it was blowing hard at the time; when Sir James replied, "There is
good anchorage in Douvarnenez Bay," and continued his course: but it
was soon after discovered that the strangers were the Plantagenet and
in-shore squadron, and the fleet was still able to weather Ushant.</p>

<p>Captain Bedford, who, like other promoters of a religious feeling on
board ship, was liable to be imposed upon by hypocrites, had on board
the Prince of Wales a set of individuals among the seamen, who, taking
advantage of his desire to encourage piety among the crew, ingratiated
themselves so far by their outward manifestations as to induce him to
appropriate a convenient berth in the ship, where they might sing
psalms and perform other devotional exercises unmolested. This place
virtually served as a depôt for the hypocrites, who had for a long
time unsuspectedly committed divers acts of depredation. Just before
the ship went into port, either to refit or replenish the water and
provisions, the secretary's gold watch disappeared, as well as a
considerable sum of money; and the complaint being made by him to the
Admiral, the latter commanded the captain to call all hands on deck,
and make a strict search for the stolen property.</p>

<p>The men being reported on deck by the officer who had charge of the
lower decks, Captain Bedford said, "Where shall we begin to search?"
to which the lieutenant replied, "My cabin, sir; then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> your's; and
then the <i>religious berth</i>." This answer drew forth a rebuke for even
<i>suspecting</i> these "good Christians," as the captain emphatically
called them. The examination was however persisted in: the officers
went to the berth, the keys were demanded, and could not be found; but
an iron crow-bar was effectually substituted; and the whole of the
missing property, besides many other stolen articles, were discovered
in the chests of these miscreants, to the surprise and mortification
of the worthy Captain Bedford, who did not fail immediately to make
his report to the Admiral then on the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>Before punishment of criminals takes place in a flag-ship, it is usual
for the captain to carry the particulars to the Admiral. It was the
practice of Sir James Saumarez to examine these reports minutely, and
convince himself of the necessity of the punishment before giving it
his sanction; which was always done with that painful reluctance so
natural to his humane disposition. In this instance, however, his
feelings of indignation were more than usually roused: he emphatically
said, "Captain Bedford, I desire that you will immediately give each
of these wretches such a punishment as will effectually put a stop to
this unparalleled wickedness."</p>

<p>We need scarcely add that his orders were implicitly obeyed; and such
was the indignation of the crew, that there was no necessity for
urging the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> boatswain's mates to do their duty, while Sir James, who
never could witness punishment without extreme pain, retired to his
cabin. He did not fail, however, to point out to every one how much
the offence of theft had been aggravated by being committed under the
cloak of religion, for which no punishment within the limited power of
the captain could be too severe.</p>

<p>A change of ministry having taken place, Lord Gardner was appointed to
command the Channel fleet; and, as his lordship chose the Ville de
Paris for his flag, Captain Conn and the other officers were turned
over to the Hibernia: three of Lord St. Vincent's officers were
superseded; and Sir James joined his new flag-ship at sea. During the
summer, when the wind came from the westward, and blew strong, the
fleet bore up for Torbay. On one of these occasions Sir James showed
much decision. The captains and officers of the fleet had sent their
chronometers on shore to be cleaned and regulated, not expecting that
there would be much occasion for them: it happened, however, that the
fleet was blown off the coast by a strong north-east wind, which
lasted more than a week. During this the ships, by chasing and
performing various evolutions, had lost the reckoning, which differed
from the true position by the chronometer of the Hibernia, which
happened to be the only one in the fleet. After the easterly wind, a
heavy westerly gale came on; and before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> Ushant could be made, the
weather became thick, and the signal was made to bear up for Torbay,
and at the same time for the longitude.</p>

<p>Sir James had now to decide: if the reckoning was right, the course by
chronometer would have wrecked the fleet in Bigberry Bay; and if the
chronometer was right, the course by reckoning would have carried the
fleet on the Bill of Portland. Under these circumstances Sir James
carefully examined both, and at once decided on following the course
by chronometer; and the fleet safely anchored in Torbay in the middle
of the night.</p>

<p>Lord Gardner took a house near Brixham, and Sir James continued for
some time to carry on the duty as usual; till at length Lord Gardner
apprised Sir James that he had applied for his old friend, Sir John
Duckworth, to be his second in command: on which Sir James wrote to be
superseded; and in August, the same year, he struck his flag, to
rehoist it on board the Inconstant at Guernsey. His old flag-ship was
during the winter prepared for him, and in February 1808 he proceeded
to Guernsey.</p>

<p>During this period, war with Russia broke out. Affairs in the north
wore a serious aspect, and it was evident that the Baltic must soon
become the seat of war.</p>

<p>Sir James received the following letter from Lord Mulgrave, offering
him the command in the East Indies, which was the most lucrative
station;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> but prize-money was always a secondary consideration with
the Admiral. He declined accepting the offer, as will be seen by his
answer.</p>

<p>The success of Buonaparte in Austria and Prussia, by which he was
enabled to force Denmark to join him against Great Britain, and which,
in the preceding year, led to the capture of Copenhagen and to the
possession of the Danish fleet, had now induced Russia to accede to
the proposal of declaring England to be in a state of blockade: Sweden
alone remained faithful. The preparations for invasion which were
making at St. Petersburg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> having alarmed King Gustavus Adolphus, the
most earnest solicitations were made for a large naval and military
force to be sent from England for its protection. A fleet was
accordingly ordered on that important service, and Sir James Saumarez
was selected as the commander-in-chief best qualified to undertake it.</p>

<p>The Victory, which had been thoroughly repaired after the battle of
Trafalgar, was commissioned at Chatham early in March, by Captain
Philip Dumaresq, for Sir James's flag, which was soon after hoisted:
Rear-admirals Sir Samuel Hood, R.G. Keats, M. Dixon, and A. Bertie,
were placed under his command. The fleet consisted of sixteen ships of
the line; and, including frigates, sloops, and gun-vessels, the number
amounted to sixty-two sail.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Admiralty, February 20th, 1808.</p>

<p class="smcap">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I am in daily expectation of receiving accurate intelligence of the
present state of the naval arsenal at Cronstadt. In the event of this
information being as satisfactory as I have reason to hope, it is my
intention to send a squadron into the Baltic, consisting of not less
than twelve or thirteen sail of the line. If your health should be
such as to admit of your taking the command of this fleet, I know of
no arrangement which I can make that would be so satisfactory to
myself, as to intrust the important service of attempting to destroy
the Russian fleet, and of affording protection to his Majesty's firm
and faithful ally, the King of Sweden, to your direction. It will not
be necessary that you should come immediately to England, (in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> the
event of your undertaking the command,) as all the necessary
preparations may be forwarded beforehand; and your coming immediately
over might tend to excite a premature suspicion of the object we have
in view. I have not yet opened this project to any officer, but those
on whom I have fixed my views to assist you, are Rear-admirals Sir
Samuel Hood and Keats, who, besides their great professional merits,
have the additional advantage of being well acquainted with the
Baltic.</p>

<p class="left50">I have the honour to be,<br />
<span class="i1">With great truth and regard,</span><br />

<hr class="c15" />
<p class="right">Guernsey, 27th February 1808.</p>

<p class="smcap">My Lord,</p>

<p> I have had the honour to receive your lordship's private and secret
letter of the 20th instant, and I feel most deeply impressed with the
very obliging manner in which your lordship has been pleased to offer
me the command of the squadron proposed to be sent to the Baltic.
Although it is with great diffidence that I undertake a trust of so
high and great importance, having ever made it the principle of my
life to go upon any service where my exertions for my king and country
would be deemed most useful, I cannot for a moment hesitate to comply
with the commands of your lordship, and I shall hold myself in
readiness to proceed from this station whenever called upon;
requesting your lordship will have the goodness to allow me sufficient
time to make such arrangements as may be required in London, previous
to my going upon the proposed service. The two officers selected to
co-operate with me, are possessed of the highest merit; and, of all
others, those I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> should have been happy to apply for, had they not
been previously appointed. I shall be obliged to your lordship to
mention the ship intended for my flag, as also such further
information as may be judged necessary for me to know, with the
probable time that I may be required to go to London; all which shall
be held by me in the strictest confidence.</p>

<p class="left50">I have the honour to be,<br />

<p>The ships composing this force proceeded to Gothenburg (the general
rendezvous) as they were ready to sail. The Victory arrived in April,
and was followed by an expedition consisting of 10,000 troops,
commanded by the gallant Sir John Moore, who arrived on the 17th of
May.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the body of French and Spanish troops, which, as
part of the army of Marshal Bernadotte, had marched to the shores of
the Belt, were obliged to halt, in consequence of the interposition of
the English fleet; and the Danish 74, Prince Christian Frederick, was
taken and destroyed, after a gallant resistance, by the Stately, 64,
Captain George Parker, and the Nassau, 64, Captain R. Campbell. On the
other hand, the Russians, who had laid siege to Sweaborg, in the Gulf
of Finland, which was justly called the Gibraltar of the North, had
induced the governor, Admiral Count Cronsted, to sign a capitulation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
that, if not relieved by the 6th of May, which was next to an
impossibility, the fortress was to be delivered up, and as a
compensation he was to receive an estate of great value in Russia. The
reason which has been assigned for this act of treachery was, that,
having refused to meet the English fleet under Lord Nelson, he had
been superseded in command of the fleet at Carlscrona, and removed to
Sweaborg, as a kind of banishment.</p>

<p>This unfortunate event paralyzed the plans of the King of Sweden; and
Sir John Moore was sent for to Stockholm. As the King of Sweden would
not give permission to land any of the troops which were on board the
transports at Gothenburg, excepting a part of the cavalry, their
detention was irksome; and the Admiral waited with much anxiety for
the return of the General, when he heard of his having been arrested,
or, at least, detained by order of the king at Stockholm. In a few
days, however, Sir John made his appearance on board the Victory; when
it was found that his Swedish Majesty had made several absurd
propositions to him, such as an attack on Copenhagen and upon
Cronstadt, for which his force was inadequate, especially since the
arrival at the former place of several regiments of French and Spanish
troops, and at the latter of the flotilla taken at Sweaborg. As Sir
John declined to undertake these expeditions, he was ordered to
remain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> at Stockholm until he had received instructions from England
respecting the disposition of his troops. Thus circumstanced, Sir John
begged permission to send his aide-de-camp, Col. Graham, (now Lord
Lynedoch,) to the Admiral with despatches; which being granted, he
changed coats with the aide-de-camp, proceeded to Gothenburg himself,
leaving the colonel in his stead, and arrived safely on board the
Victory, to the great joy of Sir James, who was no less alarmed for
Sir John's safety, than puzzled as to what measures would be most
advisable to effect his release from unwarrantable confinement.</p>

<p>The following extract of a letter from Sir James to his brother,
written from Gothenburg, will afford the best account that can be
given of the state of affairs at the time he arrived there:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">14th May 1808.</p>

<p>I fear you will be disappointed at the little information I can give
you; it will, however, be satisfactory to know that none of the
enemy's troops have, as yet, been enabled to cross the Sound, or get a
footing on any part of Sweden. The Danes have about 30,000 troops in
the island of Zealand; and at Funen and Holstein there are about
30,000 French, Spaniards, and Dutch: but the Sound and Belts are so
closely watched, that it will be very difficult for any number of
vessels to escape our different cruisers stationed to intercept them.</p>

<p>The Swedish troops on the frontiers of Norway, under the orders of
General Armfeldt, have had several skirmishes with the Danes, which
have in general proved very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> favourable to the former; but nothing of
importance has yet taken place, owing to the roads being almost
impassable from the depth of snow and ice, which, even at this
advanced season, cover them. Last Wednesday, accounts were received
from Stockholm, of the surrender of Sweaborg! It was the more
unexpected from the garrison having withstood two assaults, in which
the Russians are said to have lost a great number of men. This event
decides the fate of Finland. Sweaborg was considered a fortress of
great importance.</p></div>

<p>The following extract, on the subject of Sir John Moore's detention
and escape, shows the state of affairs up to his departure from
Gothenburg on the 1st of July:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Victory, 30th June 1808.</p>

<p>You will have been surprised at the length of time we have been
detained here, and particularly so when I inform you that the troops
are returning to England, owing principally to this government not
choosing to accede to the terms upon which it was proposed they should
be employed in this country. It is truly to be lamented that so much
delay should have taken place, and so much time lost, when their
services might have been so well employed elsewhere. Between
ourselves, much irritability has been shown by the King of Sweden in
the different conferences Sir John Moore has had with him. Finding Sir
John earnest in his intentions to return to England, he sent one of
his officers to signify to him, he was not to leave Stockholm till his
pleasure, which, of course, was considered as putting him under an
arrest, a most unprecedented measure, and an outrage certainly offered
to a friendly nation. Sir John, however, took a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> favourable
opportunity to get away from Stockholm, and arrived here last evening.</p>

<p>I trust and hope this will not lead to a rupture between the two
countries; but so unwarrantable and violent a proceeding cannot easily
be settled. I own to you, I never formed any expectation that the
troops would be of essential service in this country. They were too
few in number to act separately; and it would not have been right to
commit them with the Swedish army, at the will and disposal of the
monarch.</p></div>

<p>Sir James writes thus to his son; Sir John Moore's expedition being
still at Gothenburg.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Victory, Gothenburg, 23rd May 1808.</p>

<p>I trust that we shall be enabled to defend Sweden during the summer;
but, when winter sets in, we shall be compelled to withdraw our ships
from the Baltic: this will expose the country to the attack of the
enemy from Zealand and the ports on the south of the Baltic. The
Swedes are a brave and upright people; they are faithful to their
prince, and are very averse to any change in their government, and
still more so to French principles. I have been twice on shore; but
being near ten miles from Gothenburg, makes it inconvenient: it is a
place of great trade; at this time, at least twelve hundred sail of
vessels of different nations are in the port.</p></div>

<p>The above is a sufficient proof of the good opinion Sir James had
formed of the Swedish character, and which, he often said, he never
had occasion to alter.</p>

<p>Sir James was now placed in one of the most anxious and arduous
situations which it was possible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> to imagine. He had to protect the
commerce of both nations in a dangerous and intricate navigation, with
which his ships were but little acquainted, opposed on every side by
Russians, Prussians, French, Danes, and Norwegians. It was requisite
that his forces should be most judiciously disposed; and great tact
and firmness were indispensable to conduct affairs under the existing
circumstances. His conduct on this, as well as on every former
occasion, was such as to deserve and obtain the high approbation of
the government, and the people of both Great Britain and Sweden. The
first letter Sir James received from Gustavus Adolphus was written in
French, of which the following is an exact copy:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Château de Stockholm, le 6 Mai 1808.</p>
<p class="smcap">Monsieur l'Amiral,</p>

<p>J'ai ordonné à mon aide-de-camp général de la marine, le Vice-amiral
Baron de Rayalin de se rendre en Sconie, pour se concerter avec vous
sur les opérations des flottes Swedoise et Anglaise contre l'ennemi
commun. Il est indispensable de déployer la plus grande activité et
energie proportionnées au danger; le Baron Rayalin vous montrera un
plan à cet effet, que j'ai arrêté, et dont communication a été faite
au Ministre de sa Majesté Britannique, resident auprès de moi, qui'il
a du vous envoyer. Je suis persuadé que vous saisirez avec plaisir
cette occasion pour remplir à ce que l'honneur et le devoir vous
prescrivent. Et sur ce je prie Dieu qu'il vous ait, Monsieur l'Amiral,
en sa sainte et digne garde; etant votre bien affectionné,</p>

<p class="right smcap">Gustaf Adolph.</p>
<p>A l'Amiral commandant les forces navales de sa<br />
Majesté Britannique, dans le Sund.</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>
<p>Baron Rayalin having, with this letter, transmitted his <i>exposé</i> of the
situation of the Swedes since the capture of Sweaborg and the recapture
of Gothland, states that the Russians and Swedes had each eleven sail of
the line: it was agreed that the Swedish fleet should be reinforced by
two ships, the Centaur of 74 guns, Rear-admiral Sir Samuel Hood, and the
Implacable 74, Captain Byam Martin, and take a position at Hango-udde, a
small, ill-fortified harbour at the north-west point of Finland, round
which the Russian flotilla must pass to attack Åbo and Åland; and that
the English commander-in-chief should employ the rest of his fleet in
blockading the enemy's coast from the Gulf of Finland to Norway,
including the coasts of Prussia, Pomerania, Denmark, the Belt, and
Sound, for the protection of commerce and the defence of the kingdom of
Sweden.</p>

<p>These matters being arranged, Sir James left Gothenburg on the 2nd of
July, in the Victory; and, passing through the Great Belt, visited the
different stations where ships were to be placed. Having taken
possession of the small island of Spröe, he proceeded to Carlscrona, the
principal naval arsenal of Sweden, and arrived there on the 10th July.</p>

<p>The ensuing extract of a letter from Sir James to a friend, on leaving
Gothenburg, will be read with interest, as it will throw some light on
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> important and difficult line of conduct he had to pursue on this
occasion.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Victory, off Gothenburg, 2nd July 1808.</p>

<p>You will, I am persuaded, feel much concern at the untoward
circumstances that have occurred, and the impossibility that must now
exist of the troops being of any service in this country. Every
arrangement is made for their sailing the moment the wind will enable
the transports to get out of the harbour; and I shall proceed at the
same time for the entrance of the Sound, off Helsinburg, which is the
station whence I can most easily communicate with the different
detachments, and at the same time receive the despatches from England.</p>

<p>The only part for me to act in the present state of things, is to
uphold the honour of the country, and, as far as lies in my power,
keep up the friendly intercourse that has hitherto been maintained
with our only ally.</p>

<p>In what light the business will be taken up at home it is impossible
for me to say. It is certain that a most flagrant outrage has been
offered by the King of Sweden in the detention of Sir John Moore; and
how far his Majesty can justify himself in the eye of our government
for so great an insult to an officer of Sir John's rank, entrusted
with the command of an army, ordered from England for the defence of
Sweden, and who went to Stockholm to confer in a confidential manner
on the measures to be adopted for putting the orders he had received
into execution, is at present difficult to conceive.</p>

<p>He had doubtless, in his own opinion, good grounds for having taken so
strong a measure, but which scarcely can be admitted when the whole
transactions that may have led to it are known to our government. This
misunderstanding is the more to be lamented at this time, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
unanimity with our ally was the only point on which we could form our
expectations of success; besides the advantage that the enemy may take
of it, and the ridicule they will of course throw upon it.</p>

<p>Sir John Moore has been embarked with me since his return, besides
General Hope. The former takes his passage on board the Audacious,
which convoys the transports to Yarmouth.</p></div>

<p>During the months of June and July, Sir James had much correspondence
with the ex-King and Queen of France, the Duchess d'Angoulême, and his
old friend the Duc d'Havre. Some difficulty attended their transport
to England; the Euryalus only being allowed to proceed on that
service, and the suite of his majesty, and the royal family amounting
to above a hundred persons. The correspondence, however, does not
possess sufficient interest to dwell further on it; suffice it to say,
that Sir James gave them all the assistance and accommodation in his
power, and that they had left Carlscrona before the Victory arrived.</p>

<p>About this time Admiral Cederström, who had vanquished the Russians at
Gothland, was called to Stockholm, and Rear Admiral Nauckhoff was
appointed in his stead, with whom Sir James exchanged letters of
congratulation. The King had gone to Åland; and, as no more was said
about the affair of Sir John Moore, things went on smoothly: Baron
Rayalin accompanied the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> King, and Mons. Gullenstolpè acted as
adjutant-general of the marine.</p>

<p>The Swedish fleet now consisted of eleven sail of the line and five
frigates, which were reinforced by the Centaur and Implacable; and
proceeded to the station before agreed on.</p>

<p>Towards the end of July, Sir James was aware of the refractory conduct
of the Spanish troops, under the Marquis of Romana, in the island of
Funen, where they had been arrested in their progress to Zealand by
the appearance of the English fleet. Rear Admiral Keats was ordered to
communicate, if possible, with Romana, who was known to be disaffected
since the news had reached him of the revolution of affairs in Spain,
and to offer every assistance to rescue the troops under his command.
It was a great satisfaction to Sir James, that, on the arrival of the
next packet, he found he had anticipated the desire of government,
from whom he received instructions to the same intent, after Sir
Richard had been detached.</p>

<p>The address and tact which Rear-admiral Keats displayed on this
occasion is well known. As soon as he had succeeded in rescuing the
Marquis of Romana, by seizing on the vessels at Nyborg, and
transporting his troops to the defenceless island of Langeland, he
despatched a vessel to Sir James, who immediately sailed from
Carlscrona,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> leaving behind Captain Hope, who went home in consequence
of the illness and subsequent demise of his wife, Lady Jemima, and
made all sail for the Belt. On this occasion Sir James gave a proof of
the decision of his character, which could not but make a deep
impression on all who were present.</p>

<p>The Victory, about sun-set, had doubled Dars Head, forming with the
opposite point in Zealand the entrance of the Great Belt from the
eastward. The wind was fresh and directly adverse, when Mr. Squire,
master of the fleet, acquainted the Admiral that the ship must anchor
for the night, as he could no longer take charge as pilot. Sir James,
who had examined the chart, and could see no great risk in working as
far as Femeren, where the channel became narrow and the soundings more
regular, demanded his reason; which being unsatisfactory, he sent for
Mr. Nelson, the master, and Mr. Webb, the north-sea pilot, but neither
would undertake the charge, or give any satisfactory reason. Sir James
immediately ordered the one master into the starboard, and the other
into the larboard main channels, to see that the lead was correctly
hove; and having directed the Cruiser brig, then in company, to keep
right a-head, he kept the ship under sail till midnight, when she had
worked up tack by tack to Femeren, a distance of six leagues. He was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
thus enabled to reach Sir Richard Keats's division on the following
day in time to concert measures for the removal of Romana's army to
Gothenburg.</p>

<p>The conduct of these inferior officers could only arise from a desire
to make themselves appear of importance, especially in the absence of
the captain of the fleet; and their messmates could not but rejoice at
their failure, as it brought them sooner to the scene of action.</p>

<p>On the 14th of August, when the Victory arrived off the battery near
the centre of Langeland, an officer was despatched to the
head-quarters of the Marquis, who embarked on board that ship on the
following morning, and before night the whole of his troops were
afloat; the Marquis was then removed to the Superb, and the convoy
proceeded to Gothenburg, under the orders of Sir Richard Keats. It was
much to be regretted that the fine regiment of Asturias could not be
rescued; but, having reached Copenhagen, they were disarmed by the
Danes and French the moment the intelligence of Romana's rescue was
known.</p>

<p>The following extract of a letter from Sir James to his brother gives
an interesting account of the rescue of Romana's army:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Victory, off Langeland, 21st August 1808.</p>

<p>I returned to the Belt from Carlscrona, in consequence of information
from Admiral Keats, which reached me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> on the 6th, that an overture had
been made by a Spanish officer for their troops to be withdrawn from
these islands. The following day the Musquito joined me from the
Admiralty, with directions upon that subject, and to make trial if any
thing could be done; fortunately, duplicates were sent to Admiral
Keats, which he received in the Belt.</p>

<p>On the 14th, having been detained by contrary winds, I received
accounts from Admiral Keats, that they had been withdrawn from the
island of Funen, and landed on Langeland. I joined last Thursday, and
the same evening an express reached me by the Mosquito, with the
information that the Russian fleet from Cronstadt had sailed, and had
been seen off Hango Udde, the station occupied by the Swedish
squadron; these last having gone within the small islands to complete
with water. Judge of my anxiety, particularly having detached those
ships to join them, under Sir S. Hood, who received the advice at
Carlscrona, in the Centaur, and was on the point of sailing to join
the other two ships, who had proceeded some days before. I trust they
will find their way to join the Swedes in safety; but it is an anxious
moment.</p>

<p>I am proceeding with this ship and the Mars to endeavour to fall in
with them; all the other ships here have the Spanish troops embarked
on board them, and on board several small vessels taken at Nyborg. It
certainly is of the greatest importance to have succeeded in
withdrawing so large a portion of the Spanish army, upwards of 9,000.
About 4,000 are left in Zealand and Jutland.</p>

<p>I hope it will not have led to any disaster. I have guarded against
any to the utmost of my power, but we cannot answer for events; and in
the course of my service I have never experienced greater anxiety than
since I have been on this station: first, with regard to the
expedition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> and the business of Sir John Moore, which for a time
paralysed all the naval operations, and certainly might have been
attended with the worst consequences. We must however hope for the
best, and trust all will turn to good.</p></div>

<p>Added to the despatches acknowledging this letter, was the following
private note from Lord Mulgrave:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Admiralty, August 25th, 1808.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Sir James,</p>

<p>I cannot let despatches go from the Admiralty without conveying to you
my hearty congratulations on the important event of the deliverance of
so large a body of the Spanish troops. Rear-admiral Keats has
conducted this service with admirable talent, zeal, and judgment. We
have a report here that the Russian fleet has put to sea; and are in
anxious hope that they may have fallen in your way. The enemy's fate
and the public interests cannot be in better hands than yours.</p>

<p class="left50">I am, dear Sir James, with great truth,<br />
<span class="i1">Yours very sincerely,</span></p>
<p class="right smcap">Mulgrave</p></div>

<p>This service being completed, Sir James hastened back to the Baltic,
and, arriving off Carlscrona, received additional intelligence of the
position of the Russian fleet. Taking along with him the Mars,
Goliath, and Africa, Salsette, Rose, and Ariel, he proceeded to the
northward; and, passing between Gothland and Sweden, made for the Gulf
of Finland, expecting to fall in with the Centaur and Implacable at
certain places of rendezvous. He was not a little disappointed at not
finding them, even at Hango Udd.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> On the 30th of August he fell in
with the Swedish frigate Camilla, Captain Troile, who came on board,
and gave him the first information of the action which had taken place
between the two fleets; it appeared that the Sewolod, a Russian
seventy-four, which had been disabled by the Implacable, had been
taken and burned by that ship and the Centaur, and that the Russian
fleet had been pursued into Rogerwick, (or Port Baltic,) where they
might be successfully attacked.</p>

<p>This joyful news was communicated to the squadron, and every ship was
instantly cleared for action. The signals were successively made to
bear up, let out reefs, and make more sail. The pilot at the same time
informed the Admiral that he had been often in Rogerwick, which is a
bay in the south side of the Gulf of Finland, formed by the islands of
East and West Roge and the main, and that he could easily take the
fleet in.</p>

<p>At two o'clock, the Swedish fleet,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> consisting of ten sail of the
line and three frigates, together with the Centaur and Implacable,
were seen at anchor off Rogerwick; a plan of which is given, showing
the position of both fleets. The general signal was made to prepare
for battle; but the Centaur telegraphed that "you must anchor in
thirty-five fathoms," in reply to the Admiral's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> signal to weigh: this
having been repeated, the signals were made to anchor, furl sails, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/115-s.jpg" width="300" height="528" alt="Rogerwick" title="" />
<p class="center"><a href="images/115-b.jpg">View larger image</a></p></div>
<p class="center">Harbour of Rogerwick, showing the positions of the
English, Swedish, and Russian fleets, 31st August 1808</p>

<p class="p2">Sir Samuel Hood, the Swedish Admiral and captain of the fleet, now
came on board; what occurred at this consultation is only known to
themselves. Subsequently, Sir James went on board the Rose; but it was
then too late to reconnoitre the enemy. Next day (31st August) was
spent also in consultation; and on the 1st of September the Victory
and Goliath got under weigh, and stood in to the entrance of the
harbour; and, having silenced a battery on the west side with one
broadside, the Admiral had, for the first time, a good view of the
position of the enemy's fleet, and was convinced that they might have
been attacked. He immediately made known his determination to attack
them on the following day, and orders were accordingly issued to that
effect; the Author was sent on board the Swedish Admiral's ship, not
only with these orders, but to remain on board to explain signals, and
assist in bringing the Swedish fleet into action. Captain Martin, of
the Implacable, was appointed acting captain of the fleet, and Captain
Pipon succeeded him.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the Russians sent on board an officer with a flag of
truce, on pretence of treating for exchange of prisoners: when he came
on board the Victory, he addressed Capt. Dumaresq in the French
language, saying that he did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> understand English. Soon after
which, the Author, happening to come on deck, recognised in this
officer Mr. Skripeetzen, his old shipmate on board the Penelope; where
he had been two years a signal midshipman; and, before that, as many
on board the Leviathan. Of course he could speak and understand
English perfectly, and he had actually his signal-book in his pocket.</p>

<p>This discovery afforded no small amusement. It was now evident that he
came on board to make <i>useful observations</i>, and his object was
completely obtained. The officers took him below, and showed him the
ship clear for action, each deck having a thousand extra shot added to
the usual number; on some of which the sailors had been exercising
their wit by writing in chalk, "Post-paid"; "Free, George
Canning";<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>&mdash;jokes which Mr. Skripeetzen did not seem to relish; and
he quitted the ship evidently confused and mortified.</p>

<p>The hopes of the Admiral and his officers were now raised to the
highest pitch; every preparation had been made, and the dawn of day of
the 2nd September was waited for with anxious expectation. The wind,
which in the evening had been favourable for the enterprise,
unfortunately veered to the southward before day-break; and, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> it
was directly against going in, an attack was impossible. As this
hard-hearted gale continued for eight days, all hopes of being able to
attack the enemy vanished.</p>

<p>The enemy in the mean time moored his ships in a compact line, with
booms moored outside; and, having marched six thousand troops from
Revel, threw up strong batteries on each side, so that his position
was soon rendered impregnable.</p>

<p>Sir James now sent, by a flag of truce, the following letter to the
Emperor Alexander:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">His Britannic Majesty's ship Victory, off Baltic Port,<br />
17th September 1808.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sire,</p>

<p>Your imperial Majesty is probably uninformed of the events that have
recently taken place in the southern parts of Europe. Spain has
succeeded in rescuing herself from the usurpation and tyranny of the
ruler of France. Portugal has also extricated herself from the baneful
hands of the enemy of all independent states; the whole of the French
forces in that country having been compelled to surrender to the
British army under Sir Arthur Wellesley. It is to be hoped that those
events will induce the powers of the Continent to unite with Great
Britain to restore that peace so highly to be desired for the welfare
of mankind.</p>

<p>Knowing it to be the object most at heart of my gracious sovereign,
and that of his Majesty's ally, the King of Sweden, should your
imperial Majesty be impressed with the same sentiments, nothing will
afford me greater happiness than to have the honour of imparting them
to my government, and to desist from further hostile operations,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> upon
condition that your Majesty will give orders to your forces to desist
from hostilities against England and her ally, and to withdraw your
forces from Swedish Finland.</p>

<p class="left45">I have the honour to be,<br />
<span class="i1">With the most profound respect,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Your imperial Majesty's</span><br />
<span class="i3">Most devoted and most obedient humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">James Saumarez</span>,<br />
Vice-admiral and commander-in-chief of his<br />
Britannic Majesty's ships in the Baltic.</p>

<p>To his imperial Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias.</p></div>

<p>This appeal to his imperial Majesty unfortunately did not reach St.
Petersburg until the day after the Emperor Alexander had left it, on
his journey to meet Buonaparte at Erfurth; and, in consequence, Sir
James received the following answer from the Russian Admiral
Tchitchagoff, the minister of the Marine:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">St. Petersburg, 12/27 Sept. 1808.</p>
<p class="smcap">Monsieur,</p>

<p>La lettre que votre excellence a adressé à sa Majesté l'Empereur m'est
parvenu à mon retour à St. Petersburg conjointement à celle que m'a
écrit Monsieur Thornton. Sa Majesté n'étant plus dans sa capitale
depuis quelque jours, je me suis empressé de la lui expédier.</p>

<p>Pendant mon séjour au Port Baltique, ayant appris que votre excellence
desiroit savoir si l'échange de nos équipages pris sur le vaisseau Le
Sewolod, contre des sujets de sa Majesté Britannique ou Swedoise
pourroit avoir lieu, je suis bien-aise de lui annoncer que des ordres
ont été donnés au general en chef commandant en Finlande de rendre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> un
nombre égal, et rang pour rang, des sujets de sa Majesté Swedoise
contre les prisonniers Russes faits dans le dernier combat.</p>

<p>En priant votre excellence de vouloir bien transmettre la ci-jointe au
ministre de sa Majesté Britannique, Monsieur Thornton, je dois la
prévenir que je n'ai point reçu les gazettes que ce dernier m'avoit
annoncés dans sa lettre.</p>

<p>Je saisis avec empressement cette occasion pour assurer votre
excellence de la considération la plus distinguée avec laquelle j'ai
l'honneur d'être, De votre excellence,</p>

<p class="left60">Très humble et très obéissant serviteur,</p>
<p class="right smcap">P. de Tchitchagoff.</p>

<p>A son Ex. Mon. le Vice-amiral Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>The letters addressed to Mr. Thornton, being to the same effect, need
not be given. The exchange of prisoners took place at a subsequent
period.</p>

<p>A negociation now ensued between the Russian and British
commanders-in-chief, for permission that the blockaded fleet should
return to St. Petersburg unmolested, on condition that a part should
be given up by the former. In answer to this proposition, his Swedish
Majesty requiring that the whole should be given up, and Sir James's
demand being for both the three-deckers and half the remainder, the
negociation was broken off, and fire-ships were fitted out as the only
chance of destroying them.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> In the mean time, the Thunder and
another bomb-ship, covered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> by the Goliath and Salsette, continued to
throw shells into the fortress, and on one occasion a magazine was
blown up; but the fleet was too far within the harbour for the shells
to reach them, or to prevent their extending a barricade of booms to
prevent the approach of fire-ships. The Erebus and a brig having
however been prepared, an attempt was made on the 20th September; but
failed, owing to the rise of the moon before the vessels could
approach.</p>

<p>The following is an extract from a letter written by Sir James to his
brother:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">Victory, off Port Baltic, 31st August 1808.</p>

<p>I have been disappointed in the expectations I so ardently formed when
I wrote you last Monday. We arrived off Hango Udd, expecting all night
to fall in with the Russian fleet; but at daylight a Swedish frigate
joined, with the information that the Swedish squadron, with the
Centaur and Implacable, had sailed on the 25th in pursuit of them, and
chased them into this harbour; the Centaur and Implacable had cut off
their rear ship, which was set on fire after her crew had been taken
out.</p>

<p>I anchored at two yesterday afternoon, and had the satisfaction to
find Sir S. Hood with the Swedish squadron at anchor, watching the
enemy's squadron in the harbour, who have been occupied in fortifying
themselves in the best manner; and I fear nothing can be attempted
with any prospect of success, <i>from what I am informed</i>.</p>

<p>I most sincerely lament not to have been in time to join our ally, as
most probably not a Russian would have escaped. My great consolation
is, that not a moment has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> been lost; and, when it is considered that
I was off here in only eight days from the time I left the Belt, it
will appear almost surprising, particularly with the north winds we
experienced.</p>

<p>Sir S. Hood and Captain Martin are beheld by the Swedes with adoration
for their heroic attack on the enemy's ship; had the Swedes sailed as
well as the Russians, not one would have escaped.</p></div>

<p>It was after this letter had been despatched that Sir James
reconnoitred the enemy in the Victory; and, consequently, determined
on an attack.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of September, Captain Bathurst, of the Salsette, and
Captain Trolle, of the Camilla, being sent to ascertain the position
of the Russian fleet, reported that they were so completely
barricaded, that any further attempt with fire-ships would be
fruitless; Sir James ordered the Erebus and Baltic to be restored to
their former condition, the brig having been burnt in the attempt.</p>

<p>In addition to the scurvy, which made its appearance in the Swedish
fleet early in the month of July, the crews were now attacked with a
malignant epidemic, which daily became more fatal; those who had been
affected by scurvy, being predisposed to catch the infection of the
fever, were invariably carried off. A Swedish ship of the line and two
frigates had been loaded with the sick from the different ships, and
sent to Carlscrona.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> As the month of September advanced, it was
evident that the Swedish fleet could not keep longer at sea; and that,
if a reinforcement did not arrive from England, the blockade must soon
be raised. Lemon-juice, sugar, &amp;c. as well as medical assistance, was
sent to the Swedes, but too late to have the desired effect.</p>

<p>Sir James, having anchored the Swedish ships farther out, persevered
as long as it was possible, and the fleets rode out two heavy gales of
wind in that exposed situation; while the Russian ships lay moored,
with yards and topmasts struck, in the position given as second in the
diagram (page 116).</p>

<p>The Swedish army in Finland had fought with great bravery, but were at
length overpowered by numbers; Åbo, the capital of Finland, was in the
end taken, and that valuable country for ever lost to Sweden. The
King, and subsequently the remains of his army, retreated to
Stockholm, and the campaign terminated decidedly in favour of Russia.</p>

<p>After what has been stated, it will not excite surprise that Sir James
should have had some anxiety about the opinion of the public, as will
be seen by the following short extract, dated 26th September, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>I am anxious to hear what will be said of the occurrences here,
although I am conscious of having acted for the good of my country to
the utmost in my power; and I trust the whole of my conduct since my
first coming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> upon the station will be entirely approved of by
government: it is very possible there may be those who will be
disposed to find fault, however unjustly.</p></div>

<p>It will be seen hereafter, that this apprehension was not ill-founded.</p>

<p>Before the arrival of the Victory and squadron off Rogerwick, Sir
Samuel Hood had despatched his first lieutenant with the intelligence
of the capture and destruction of the Russian seventy-four, Sewolod,
and of the position of the Russian fleet. This officer was, of course,
the bearer of many letters, which described the enemy's ships to be in
a situation easily to be attacked, when the commander-in-chief should
arrive. The expectations of the nation, from the known prowess of Sir
James Saumarez, were therefore raised to the highest pitch. When the
information subsequently reached England that he had not attacked
them, it is not to be wondered at that blame should be attached to him
by the public, who could not be aware of the existence of those
circumstances which frustrated his intentions; and so long did this
impression last, that it was only in 1834 that the Author explained
the causes to his late Majesty, who had always been impressed with the
idea that it was Sir James, and not the Swedish Admiral and Sir Samuel
Hood, that objected to the attack; though certainly the very reverse
was the fact. There can be no doubt that, if Sir James<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> had been
authorised to take command of the Swedish fleet, he would, even
against the opinion of Sir Samuel, have attacked the enemy's fleet on
the 31st of August; and, as the wind changed on the following morning,
he would have been able to carry off all his prizes without any
difficulty. We have ever since lamented that the attempt, as planned
by Sir James, was not promptly made.</p>

<p>The official description of the action with the Russian fleet will be
found in the Appendix; as also Sir James's correspondence with his
Swedish Majesty on the subject.</p>

<p>As it was hoped that some shift of wind would enable us to attack the
enemy, we remained in a state of anxiety for three weeks. In the
interim, intelligence was received of the success of the British arms
in Spain, and of the expulsion of the French from Portugal. Sir James,
in consequence of this information, and of the opinions before
mentioned, and seeing that the enemy could neither be attacked nor
blockaded any longer, weighed anchor on the 30th of September, and in
company with the Swedes proceeded to Carlscrona, where he arrived on
the 9th of October.</p>

<p class="p2"></p>

<p>On Sir James's arrival at Carlscrona, he was received with every mark
of attention and respect by Admiral Puké, the governor, and other
authorities. The sick, amounting to 3,000, were landed from the
Swedish fleet; and their hospitals were visited and supplied, as far
as possible, with medicine from the English, while they on the other
hand received fresh provisions, vegetables, and water.</p>

<p>Arrangements being made for the protection of the commerce, and
convoys, which were to sail as long as the sea was open, Sir James,
and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> Swedes themselves, aware of the inefficiency of the Swedish
ships of war compared with the English, and desirous that they should
be in a better state to co-operate next season, complied with the
request of Admiral Nauckhoff, to leave the Author with them during the
winter, to assist in their operations of refitting, &amp;c.</p>

<p>On his leaving Carlscrona, Sir James received the following farewell
letter from that officer:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">His Swedish Majesty's ship Gustaf IV. Adolf,<br />
20th October 1808.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honour to acknowledge your excellency's letter of the 18th
of this month, in which your excellency has been pleased, in the most
polite and flattering terms, to mark your satisfaction with the
co-operation of the Swedish squadron, and the conduct of the
commanders of the ships under my orders.</p>

<p>It is impossible for me to express the sentiments of esteem and
gratitude for the unremitting and zealous exertions with which your
excellency on every occasion has been pleased to promote the interest
of my sovereign and country. His Majesty, my royal master, will be
duly informed of the valuable services rendered to him and to the
Swedish nation by your excellency, and the gallant flag-officers,
captains, and others under your command; and I shall certainly regard
your excellency's appointment to the command of the British fleet in
these seas, as a most convincing proof of the inviolable friendship
which his only but most faithful and powerful ally the King of Great
Britain entertains for him, and for the promotion of Swedish
interests.</p>

<p>I beg your excellency will be pleased to convey my best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> thanks to
every admiral, captain, and officer under your excellency's command,
for all the attention and the very active zeal which they have on
every occasion displayed. The care and attention which the worthy Dr.
Jameson, and the surgeon Mr. Duke, have given to the sick, will ever
be remembered with sentiments of sincere gratitude.</p>

<p class="left50">I have the honour to remain,<br />
<span class="i1">With the highest regard and consideration,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Your excellency's</span><br />
<span class="i3">Most obedient and very humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right smcap">Nauckhoff, Rear-admiral.</p></div>

<p>Admiral Nauckhoff struck his flag on the 15th of November; at which
time the mortality and sickness had been so great, that only three
frigates could be manned to assist in the protection of the trade.</p>

<p>Sir James left Carlscrona on the 25th October, and, passing through
the Great Belt, reached Gothenburg on the 29th of November. Here he
remained in the Victory until the 3rd of December, during which
interval he made the necessary arrangements for the protection of the
trade in that quarter; and, leaving Rear-admiral Keats in the Superb,
and, under his command, the Orion and two smaller vessels, he
proceeded to the Downs, where he landed on the 8th, and appeared at
the Admiralty on the 9th current. Their lordships were pleased to
signify their high approbation of every part of his conduct, as far as
the naval operations were concerned; but they considered his address
to the Emperor of Russia a stretch of power. Of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> this the public will
judge. Sir James did no more, in fact, than propose an armistice,
which is undoubtedly the province of every commander-in-chief. It is
indeed true that Buonaparte, who was at Erfurth when the Emperor
Alexander received his letter, made this the basis of a deceitful
overture for peace, in order to gain time, and thereby puzzle the
ministers a little; but this circumstance can never be held out as a
reason for preventing a commander-in-chief at a great distance from
home concluding an armistice, when he is confident it would be
beneficial to the cause on which he is engaged.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the Russian fleet, with the exception of two ships,
which were lost on the passage, succeeded in returning to Cronstadt.
It was said that Admiral Henikoff, who commanded, was degraded in
consequence of his conduct in not engaging the Swedish fleet.</p>

<p>The mortality continued at Carlscrona among the seamen until the cold
weather set in about Christmas, when it was calculated that the Swedes
had lost a number nearly equal to the original crews of their ships,
including sixty-four officers; among whom were fourteen of the rank of
captain (lieut.-col. in their service).</p>

<p>The Orion sailed with the first convoy in November, which she carried
successfully through the Belt. The next ship was the Africa, which,
after seeing her convoy through the Malinö channel,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> was attacked by
Danish gun-boats in a calm, and suffered so severely as to oblige her
to return to Carlscrona. The Mars, Orion, and two bombs, made an
unsuccessful attack on <ins title="Corrected erratum: original reads 'Eurthalms'">Eartholms.</ins>; but the last convoy which left
Carlscrona, under the Salsette, Magnet, and two Swedish sloops of war,
was the most disastrous undertaking of all. They sailed on the 23rd
December, after the winter set in with unusual severity. A storm
coming on from the northward, brought the already-formed ice down on
the convoy. The Magnet (Captain Morris) was wrecked, with several
others; the rest, with the Salsette and two Swedish armed ships, were
carried back into the Baltic; and, excepting the Salsette, none of
them were ever heard of.</p>

<p>The gallant Captain Bathurst, who afterwards fell gloriously at
Navarin, after suffering severe hardships by being frozen out the
whole winter, during which his ship was drifted twice round the island
of Bornholm, was able to approach Carlshamn in March, and was cut into
that harbour by the Swedes, who afforded him every assistance. The
Swedish armed ships were lost by being carried by the ice on a
sandbank in sight of the Salsette, which had then only four feet water
to spare; the former, immediately they struck, turned bottom up, and
all hands perished, being instantly covered with the ice. The
thermometer, in January 1809, sank to forty-five degrees below zero;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
the Sound and Belt were completely frozen over, and many passed
between Sweden and Denmark on horseback over the ice.</p>

<p>The Author did not escape the infection at Carlscrona, but was one of
the first who recovered, and was sent for by the King to Stockholm; it
was, however, the middle of February before he could undertake the
journey.</p>

<p>There were at one time nineteen packets due from England.</p>

<p>Things in Sweden began to take a different turn. The conduct of the
King in disgracing his guards, because, after beating three times
their number of Russians in Finland, they were obliged to retreat, and
could no longer defend Åbo, the capital of that province, rendered him
unpopular; and a conspiracy was formed, at the head of which was
Aldercreutz, the general who had been in Finland, in conjunction with
Aldersparre, who commanded the western army, which was secretly set in
motion for Stockholm from the frontiers of Norway, and had arrived at
Orebro before reports of its progress reached the King.</p>

<p>On the night of the 8th of March, his Majesty issued orders for all
the troops to get under arms at daylight; and on the morning of the
9th he demanded the specie from the bank, intending to set off with it
to Scania. The ministers and officers of state were summoned to the
council; and others,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> among whom was the Author, were required to
attend his levee at nine o'clock, which was the moment fixed on by the
conspirators, who entered, and told the King that he must not leave
Stockholm. Drawing his sword, his Majesty made a pass at one of the
conspirators: in the mean time the General seized the <i>staff of
power</i>,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and ordered the others to seize the King, which they
immediately obeyed by forcing him into the next room. They forgot,
however, when they locked the door, that there was a private entrance,
out of which the King immediately escaped, and appearing on the
staircase, below which the Author was standing, he called loudly for
help. Some of the conspirators, however, with great presence of mind,
called to the soldiers on duty, "The King is mad;" on which they again
secured him, and in the evening he was removed to Drottningholm, where
his family resided.</p>

<p>The conspirators then went to his uncle the Duke of Sudermania, and,
having represented the state of the King, requested he would assume
the reins of government, to which he readily assented; and a
proclamation was forthwith issued, declaring that Gustaf IV. Adolf was
unable to govern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> the nation, and that his uncle had assumed the royal
authority in his stead.</p>

<p>This proclamation made no sensation, and things went on as if nothing
had happened.</p>

<p>The new regent and government were of course anxious to have the
matter set favourably before the government of England; and, in order
to prove that the King was actually deranged, the regent submitted to
the Author a paper found in the dethroned King's desk, certainly in
his own handwriting, in which he described himself as the "Man on the
white horse" in the Revelations, and declared that he must fight a
battle under the walls of Copenhagen, which would give peace to
Europe.</p>

<p>The Author, who had only a few days before been named aide-de-camp and
adjutant to the fleet, had no longer any command, and therefore
demanded his passports, which were granted: but, understanding that he
was to be arrested at Orebro, he left Stockholm two hours sooner than
the stated time of his departure, and by pretending that he was a
Swedish officer who had despatches for Count Rosen at Gothenburg, and
that the English officer was some hours behind, he escaped through the
western army, after being questioned and examined by Aldersparre. He
at length arrived safe on board the Superb, which had cut out of the
ice into Wingo Sound; and, being immediately forwarded by a packet,
reached London<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> in only nine days, where he found Sir James Saumarez
preparing to resume his command.</p>

<p>It has been seen that, after Sir James's arrival in London, he was
offered the chief command in the East Indies, which he declined
chiefly because he did not consider his health equal to it; but he was
not allowed to remain long idle. A squadron of the enemy's ships
having escaped the vigilance of the Brest blockading fleet, Sir James
was ordered to hoist his flag in the Mars, and proceed to sea in
search of them: but their return into port before his squadron could
be reported ready, did away with the necessity of his following them;
and the affairs in Sweden rendering more necessary than ever, that an
officer of his rank, character, and abilities should be sent to the
Baltic, he was reappointed to that important command.</p>

<p>In the mean time Captain Searle was appointed to the Victory,
Vice-captain Dumaresq, who had left her in consequence of a severe
family affliction. The former was sent to Corunna, and was one of the
fleet which brought home the remains of the army of the gallant but
unfortunate Sir John Moore. On her return, Captain Dumaresq returned
to the ship, as also Captain Hope, in his former situation; and Sir
James's flag was hoisted in April at the Nore, whence she sailed soon
after.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> His instructions were to proceed to Gothenburg, and take under
his command all his Majesty's ships and vessels employed and to be
employed in the Baltic: he was to consider the protection of the trade
his principal object; to watch the Russian fleet, and attack it if
possible. In the present state of Sweden no precise instruction could
be given: but he was to preserve as long as possible an amicable
intercourse with the Swedes; to use every means in his power to
encourage and protect the trade of his Majesty's subjects with Sweden;
to be cautious not to give offence to its government, and to afford
protection to such Swedish vessels as might require it; to keep up the
supply of water and provisions in the fleet, so as not to be dependent
on the supplies from Swedish ports; and finally, to guard against the
admission of the infectious disease which was at that time prevalent
in Sweden.</p>

<p>The Victory arrived at her station on the 6th May, when a
correspondence took place between Sir James and Mr. Merry, the British
minister and chargé d'affaires. Sir James informed the latter that the
Alexandria was ordered to take his excellency to England if required,
which offer was accepted by Mr. Merry. Mr. Augustus Foster was left as
chargé d'affaires, who announced his appointment in a letter to Sir
James, dated Stockholm, 7th May. He describes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> the state of Sweden to
be most unsettled and perplexing, but that no change had taken place
in regard to her relations with England.</p>

<p>The following is a continuation of the correspondence between Sir
James and Mr. Foster:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Victory, in Wingo Sound, 11th May 1809.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>Having arrived at this anchorage on the 4th instant, and Rear-admiral
Sir Samuel Hood being parted for England, in consequence of the ill
state of his health, I opened your letter addressed to the
Rear-admiral, dated 7th instant, informing him of your being appointed
his Majesty's chargé d'affaires in the absence of Mr. Merry.</p>

<p>I have the honour to inform you that I shall feel highly gratified by
any communication you may be pleased to make to me relating to his
Majesty's service, and which may be interesting for my knowledge as
commander-in-chief in these seas; and I shall be happy in conveying to
you any information in my power, which may be connected with his
Majesty's service.</p>

<p>His excellency Mr. Merry sailed yesterday for England, on board his
Majesty's ship Alexandria. From him I received such information as he
possessed to the period of his leaving Stockholm. I propose to detach
Rear-admiral Dixon, who joined me the 9th instant in the Temeraire, to
relieve Sir Richard G. Keats; and I propose to continue here for some
time longer for the more speedy communication with England, as well as
to receive what you may do me the honour to write to me; giving you
due notice previously to my proceeding for the Baltic.</p>

<p>The accounts rumoured of the pretended defeat of the Austrians, I
trust, will not prove correct; and we must not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> be surprised at the
circulation of exaggerated accounts of the success of Buonaparte in
the present state of affairs on the continent and in the northern
parts of Europe.</p>

<p class="left50">I have the honour to be,<br />
<span class="i1">With great truth and respect,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Sir, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</span></p>
<p class="right smcap">James Saumarez.</p>

<p>To A. Foster, Esq. his Britannic Majesty's<br />
chargé d'affaires, Stockholm.</p>
<hr class="c15" />

<p class="right">Stockholm, 15th May 1809.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>Scarcely had the letter which I wrote to your excellency late last
night been received by the person who set out with it this morning,
when a note reached me from Baron de Lagerbjelke, minister for foreign
affairs <i>ad interim</i> of this government, to inform me of his having
important communications to make to me, and appointing an hour for a
conference with me this forenoon.</p>

<p>The object of this conference was to expose to me the critical
position in which Sweden is placed at this moment, from her desire to
remain in amity and maintain her commercial intercourse with Great
Britain, of which, as he was pleased to express himself, she was on
the point of becoming the victim; and to ask of me to explain to you
the full extent of her dangers, in the confidence that you would give
her all the assistance in your power which her perilous situation
requires, without waiting for instructions for the purpose from his
Majesty's government; it not being the interest of England that this
country should be conquered by Russia, although the same alliance no
longer existed between his Majesty and the Swedish government.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
Buonaparte has evaded the repeated solicitations of Sweden to take
into his own hands the management of the negociation for a peace,
which this country is willing to enter into with all her enemies; and
has referred her for the terms of such a peace entirely to the court
of St. Petersburg. This court, meanwhile, has manifested the most
marked discontent at the delays which have already taken place in the
negociation; and has insisted, as a preliminary condition to the
treating for peace, that this country should enter into the alliance
against Great Britain. She has also declared the kind of armistice
concluded by her generals at an end; and Baron Schwaren, who had been
sent on a mission to St. Petersburg, which place he left the 24th
ultimo, returned here on the 6th instant, bringing intelligence of
very formidable preparations which are making in Finland for the
immediate invasion of this country, while the Russian army at Torneo
has been considerably reinforced.</p>

<p>Baron de Lagerbjelke gave me the assurances of the Duke of Sudermania,
that every effort shall be made on the part of Sweden to repel the
meditated attack of Russia, and that his Royal Highness is determined
not to yield to the conditions of peace proposed by her, as long as he
has the means of defending himself; but he proposes that your
excellency should on your part aid him in his defence, by displaying
first a part of the fleet under your command in the Sound and on the
coast of Denmark, to deter the Danes from making an attack on the
southern provinces of Sweden, while the troops and sailors necessary
for the defence of this part of the kingdom shall be withdrawn from
these shores. Secondly, that you should engage to send such a force
into the Baltic sea as to render it dangerous for the Russians to make
any attempt with ships of the line against the harbours, or to carry
an invading<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> force against the coast of Sweden. And thirdly, that by
detaching sloops of war, brigs, and frigates in the direction from
Norrköping and Stockholm, as far as Gefle, you should strew such a
force in those seas as to intimidate the Russian General in Finland
from embarking his troops on board the flotilla at Åbo, for the
purpose of attacking at once the centre of this kingdom. Such are the
paucity of means, and so few the troops which this government can
assemble for the defence of Sweden against so powerful an enemy, that
the invasion cannot in all probability but succeed, unless your
excellency can send the aid the King desires.</p>

<p>On the supposition that you might act in consequence of the
above-mentioned representation of this government, I observed to Baron
de Lagerbjelke, that, from the remoteness of the seas in the
neighbourhood of Åland and Gefle, it was very probable that many of
your officers might be unacquainted with them, and thereby risk being
thrown into situations of danger; on which he observed, that through
the means of his father, the minister of marine, he should take care
that pilots should be sent out to meet you whenever it was ascertained
that any of the ships under your command were coming into these seas.
The navigation of the Gulf of Bothnia promises now to be open in ten
days or a fortnight; and therefore this government hopes, in case you
should accede to their wishes, that as little time as possible may be
lost in the execution of them.</p>

<p>Three Swedish frigates, as Baron de Lagerbjelke gave me to understand,
have been ordered round from Carlscrona to cruise off these coasts;
and 106 gun-boats, hemmemas, and other vessels, are at present in or
near the water; but the want of men from the mortality of the last
winter is severely felt, and can only be supplied from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> south, in
case you think fit to coincide with the views of this government.</p>

<p class="left65">I have, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">Augt. Foster.</p>
<p>Vice-admiral Sir James Saumarez, Bart, and K.B.<br />
<span class="i2">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</span></p></div>

<p>This was the first communication which had been made by the Swedish
government since Gustaf IV. Adolf was deposed, and his uncle had
accepted the regency with full powers. By this <i>exposé</i> it appears
that their first act after the revolution was to try to make peace
singly with Buonaparte, which was of course refused; because the
Swedes could give him nothing in return, and shutting the ports
against Great Britain was a preliminary that could not be dispensed
with. There was no alternative therefore but to apply to England for
protection against their inveterate enemies the Russians, who had
already possessed themselves of all Finland, and were preparing for
the invasion of Sweden. Mr. Foster added the following private opinion
on the state of affairs, which now became so interesting:</p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">Stockholm, 15th May 1809.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have written you a long public letter upon the wishes of this
government for your co-operation in the defence of Sweden. My private
opinion is, that the Swedes, in addition to their desire to maintain
their commercial relations with us, (which of course they wish should
be still carried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> on, though by secret understanding,) entertain the
design of preventing the Russians from interfering in their interior
concerns; they also hope the French may be ultimately victorious
against Austria, as they suppose they will not be inclined to the
confirming of Russia in her conquest of Finland; which considerations
make this government so backward in accepting the terms proposed by
Russia. In the mean time they are in a most deplorable state, and
cannot, I believe, collect 10,000 men: without your assistance they
must perish or yield; with your aid it will be but a respite, I dare
say, but perhaps of use for the Swedes.</p>

<p>The news of to-day is rather better: on the Tagliamento it would
appear the Austrians are victorious; and in Poland, where Colonel
Marfeld is said to have cut off some Russians, marched on Warsaw, and
to be about besieging Dantzic: these latter want confirmation. The
French, I fear, have crossed the Inn, but with great loss.</p>

<p class="left65">I have, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">Augt. Foster.</p>
<p>Vice-admiral Sir James Saumarez, Bart. and K.B.<br />
<span class="i2">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</span></p></div>

<p>To the above letters Sir James returned the following satisfactory
answer, which decided the plan of his operations for this year:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Victory, Wingo Sound, Gothenburg, 18th May 1809.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have just received the honour of your letter of the 15th instant, by
the messenger Mears, acquainting me with the particulars of a
conference you had with Baron de Lagerbjelke on the present critical
state of Sweden, in consequence, as he was pleased to state to you, of
her desire to remain in amity, and maintain her commercial relations,
with Great Britain; and requesting you to explain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> to me the full
extent of her danger, in the confidence that I should give all the
assistance in my power which her perilous situation required, without
waiting for instructions from his Majesty's government. Also informing
me of the formidable preparations making in Finland for the immediate
invasion of Sweden.</p>

<p>The assurances made to you through Baron de Lagerbjelke, on the part
of the Duke of Sudermania, that every effort will be made to repel the
meditated attack of Russia, and that his Royal Highness has determined
not to yield to the conditions of peace proposed to him, as long as he
has the means of defending himself, will decide me in employing the
fleet under my command in the best manner in my power for the defence
of Sweden; for which purpose an adequate force will be stationed in
the Sound and on the coast of Denmark, to intimidate the Danes from
making any attack on the southern provinces of Sweden; and a squadron
of line of battle ships will be employed in the Baltic to watch the
Russian fleet, and prevent any attempt on their part to carry an
invading army against the coast of Sweden from the side of Finland.</p>

<p>As the attention of the Swedish marine will be principally confined to
the defence of Stockholm, and the coast within the Gulf of Bothnia, it
is to be presumed that, with proper exertion, they will be perfectly
adequate to that service; and as three Swedish frigates have been
ordered to cruise on that station, with other armed vessels, and one
hundred and six gun-boats, no doubt can be entertained of their being
for the present sufficient to repel the enemy; and I shall readily
order such further part of the force under my command, as can be
spared from other services, to co-operate in that quarter. The
important transactions going on in the southern coast of the Baltic,
in which the interest of Sweden is materially concerned, require a
considerable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> part of the force under my orders for that particular
service; but I have the honour to assure you, that every effort will
be exerted for the protection and security of Sweden against any
attack of the enemy.</p>

<p>You will be pleased to take the necessary measures that orders may be
given for his Majesty's ships to be supplied with water, and such
necessaries as they may stand in need of, at Carlscrona and other
Swedish ports; and pilots when they require them.</p>

<p class="left50">I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</p>

<p>Augt. Foster, Esq.<br />
<span class="i2">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</span></p>
<hr class="c15" />

<p class="right">Victory, in Wingo Sound, 18th May 1809.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have replied to your public letter as fully as I can consider myself
warranted, without having received any special instructions on the
subject from his Majesty's government; but, considering it to be the
intention to maintain the terms of amity with Sweden so long as it can
be done consistently, and prevent the country from falling a prey to
the common enemy, I trust to be right in using my efforts for that
purpose; and I hope to receive the sanction of ministers on the
measure I am adopting. I shall proceed for the Baltic the moment it
lies in my power; but the late prevailing calms and adverse winds have
prevented the arrival of the ships on their way to join me, and no
accounts later than the 5th from London have reached this place. I
sent, three days since, a small detachment of ships to take possession
of Anholt, where supplies of water could be obtained, and which would
also be a proper place for convoys to resort to in the event of
exclusion from the Swedish ports.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> Any information you can favour me
with respecting the state of the Russian fleet at Cronstadt will be
highly desirable, and also the probable time they may be enabled to
put to sea from that port.</p>

<p class="left65">I have, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">James Saumarez.</p>
<p>To Augt. Foster, Esq.<br />
<span class="i2">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</span></p></div>

<p>As the next letter from Mr. Foster gives an account of the Russian
forces and other interesting particulars, we have given it a place
here, which makes any further account of the situation of Sweden
unnecessary.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Stockholm 14th May 1809.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I received this evening the letter which your excellency did me the
honour to write to me, dated the 11th instant, in answer to one which
I had written to Rear-admiral Sir Samuel Hood on the 7th.</p>

<p>I take the opportunity of a private conveyance to have this forwarded
to you at Gottenburg; and I beg to assure you that no efforts shall be
wanting on my part to procure information which may be interesting to
you as commander-in-chief in these seas, and to convey it to you as
speedily as possible.</p>

<p>Our relations with Sweden have not changed materially since Mr.
Merry's departure. Indeed, this government has had no stated form
hitherto; though now the Duke of Sudermania is empowered to treat for
peace, or to continue war. The Russians have a disposable force of
near 20,000 men in Finland, and 105 gun-boats, and are building more,
which creates alarm here; and it has been strongly insinuated by
several of the officers of government here to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> me, that nothing could
be more grateful to them than such movements of the fleet under your
command, sir, as would overawe the Danes, while they should deter the
Russians from attempting invasion on the Bothnia coasts of this
country; or which, by giving them security in Scania, would enable
them to draw their forces this way.</p>

<p>Captain Tillard will sail on the 20th instant, with about eighteen or
nineteen merchant-ships under his convoy.</p>

<p class="left65">I have, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">Augt. Foster.</p>
<p>Vice-admiral Sir Jas. Saumarez, Bart, and K.B.</p></div>

<p>Sir James soon after received a letter in the French language from
R.A. Nauckhoff, containing the same <i>exposé</i> and request as Baron
Lagerbjelke had made. He concludes with the following additional
particulars:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>Les états du Royaume de Swede ont déclaré par un acte formel, le 12 de
ce mois, que le Roi ci-devant, aussi que son fils, a perdu tout le
droit au trône ou à la couronne de Swede pour jamais: c'est la
mauvaise conduite dans le gouvernement, dont tout le Royaume est mis
en misère, qui a causé le malheur de ce Roi et sa famille. Le Duc
Charles est, en attendant, Regent avec tout le pouvoir du Roi, et il
sera fait et déclaré pour Roi de Swede aussitôt que les états ont eu
le tems pour faire une autre forme de regence. Dans le moment on
apporte la nouvelle que les Autrichiens ont totalement battu l'armée
de Napoleon. Si cela se manifeste, je n'en doute pas que cela causerat
des grands changemens chez les puissances du Nord.</p></div>

<p>The attack on the island of Anholt, for which Sir James had previously
obtained the sanction of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> government, was completely successful. The
detachment consisted of the Standard, sixty-four, Captain Hollies; the
Owen Glendower, thirty-six; Avenger, Rose, Ranger, sloops; and Snipe,
gun-boat: this was reinforced by the marines of the Victory, under
Captain Peter Jones, who particularly distinguished himself.</p>

<p>The governor, having been summoned, refused to surrender; when the
marines of the squadron were immediately landed, under Captain
Nicolls, who was senior officer, and who soon stormed their batteries,
and obliged the governor to surrender at discretion.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>The objects of this capture were to obtain a supply of water, a
rendezvous for convoys, and the destruction of a retreat for
privateers. Sir James appointed Captain Nicolls governor of Anholt,
which was confirmed by the Admiralty. Rear-admiral Sir Samuel Hood
returned to England on account of ill health, and was replaced by
Rear-admiral Pickmore, who was stationed in the Belt under
Rear-admirals Keats and Manly Dixon; while Rear-admiral Bertie was
stationed at Helsingburg: the former three having the care and
directions of convoying the fleets of merchant ships through the Belt;
the latter through the Sound and Malmö channel. Sir James, in passing
through the Great Belt, visited the station at the island of Spröe,
and afforded protection to a numerous convoy of merchant ships passing
at that time, and trading under neutral colours, under a licence from
the English and the Swedish governments.</p>

<p>After touching at Ystad, Sir James arrived at Carlscrona on the 4th of
June: from Ystad, he wrote the following letter to Mr. Foster:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Victory, Great Belt, 29th May 1809.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I had the honour yesterday morning to receive your letter of the 19th,
inclosing one from Admiral Nauckhoff addressed to me, and also the
copy of General Wrede's report on the state of the north. I have been
detained by adverse currents and calms since my departure from
Gottenburg;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> but think myself fortunate in having been as early as
Admiral Dixon, who sailed eight days before me, and with whom I fell
in yesterday evening off Langeland.</p>

<p>The Danish force of gun-boats in the Belt has been considerably
increased since last year. The Melpomene frigate was attacked by
several in the night of the 23rd, and had four men killed besides
about twenty wounded. Captain Warren, in having drawn their attention,
succeeded in preserving a numerous convoy at anchor near Langeland,
which seemed to have been the principal object for which they came
out. The Ardent having very injudiciously landed a party of men on the
island of Ramsoe, for the purpose of procuring a supply of wood and
water, they suffered themselves to be surprised, and about eighty men
were made prisoners.</p>

<p>I am hastening with all despatch towards Carlscrona, and I hope to
have the honour of hearing from you in my way off Ystad. I think it
right to mention, <i>in confidence</i>, that I shall not have more than six
sail of the line of battleships with me, until I can be joined by
those that may be on their way from England.</p>

<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honour to acquaint you with my arrival off Ystad this
afternoon, and that I have received your letter of the 23rd instant,
informing me of the satisfaction expressed by the Swedish minister, M.

government in affording them all the assistance in my power; and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
Vice-admiral Stedinck had promised to take the necessary steps for the
fleet under my command being supplied with water and necessaries, as
well as pilots; and also informing me of the exertions used by the
Swedish marine for the defence and security of the country.</p>

<p>As it may be necessary for convoys to pass through the Malmö channel,
I trust you have represented the expediency of the co-operation of the
Swedish gun-boats stationed there; and I request you will please to
signify to the Swedish government that all the protection in my power
to afford the trade of Sweden, shall be granted to them.</p>

<p>I am proceeding with all despatch off Carlscrona, where I hope to have
the honour of hearing further from you: as I shall probably proceed
from Carlscrona off Dalarö, you will permit me to have such letters or
despatches as may arrive for me at Gottenburg from England to be
addressed to your care. I have, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Sir James, while off Ystad, had the honour of receiving on board
Prince William of Orange, who was the bearer of news which had great
effect in deciding the Swedes in their choice of the line of policy to
be pursued at this critical period. This account, which is detailed in
Sir James's next letter to Mr. Foster, led to a correspondence which
showed the nature of his opinion as to the integrity of the Swedes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Victory, off Ystad, 3rd June 1809.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have the greatest satisfaction in transmitting to you the copy of a
bulletin, detailing a statement of the important victory gained by the
Archduke Charles over Buonaparte on the 21st and 22nd of May. It was
delivered to me by his highness Prince William of Orange, who, with
two attendants, arrived on board the Victory yesterday from Colberg,
on his way to England. There is every reason to hope this victory will
have been followed up by other important successes, which will decide
the other states in uniting with Austria to extirpate the tyrant of
the human race. I am proceeding to Carlscrona, where I trust to find
letters from you; and, in the present critical state of affairs with
this country, I hope to be forgiven for again repeating my anxious
wish to have the honour of hearing from you as frequently as possible.</p>

<p>Admiral Bertie, who is stationed off Helsinburg, wrote to me that he
has made repeated applications through Mr. Consul Fenwick for pilots,
but has not been able to procure any: as this is an object of great
importance, I request you will represent it to the Swedish government.
He also mentions his suspicions that a better understanding exists
with the Danes, from the frequent flags of truce, and also from some
prisoners having been exchanged from Denmark, which he states as a
circumstance very unusual.</p>

<p>Sir R.G. Keats also informs me, that two ships of the line and a
frigate are fitting with expedition, intended, as is reported, to
transfer troops to the eastward; but he adds that it was also rumoured
that the ports of Sweden are expected to be shut against us even
before the 14th. Although I feel the greatest confidence that there
can exist no intention on the part of Sweden to deceive, we cannot be
too much on our guard with that government, should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> they find it
necessary to enter upon terms with either Russia or Denmark.</p>

<p class="center">Confidential.</p>
<p class="right">Stockholm, June 9th, 1809.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I thank you for, and sincerely congratulate you on, the interesting
news which you have been so obliging to send me from off Ystad. It is
complete and glorious indeed, and will add to the other reasons I
shall entertain for thinking that this government cannot mean to
deceive us. Their situation is certainly a very delicate one; but,
till now, I have no reason to complain of any insincerity on the part
of the Swedes. Be assured that, if I had, I should instantly despatch
notice of it to you. I do not like to venture writing general opinions
by the common post, and therefore I have appeared perhaps to write to
you too little at length hitherto. The post is also very tardy, or you
must have received letters from me of the 23rd ultimo; one of the 30th
must also be lying for you at Ystad. I shall now make a practice of
writing to you by every post, as you very naturally will be glad to
hear even negative news. Admiral Bertie's suspicions are very natural
for him to entertain, but I really believe entirely unfounded.</p>

<p>The situation of Norway (which, I will confide to you, seems more
critical for Denmark than for Sweden,) will account for so many
couriers passing. The desire of peace, openly manifested by this
country, accounts for their allowing such passage, which has for some
time been permitted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> in return for the passage through Denmark being
allowed to Swedish officers. As to a better understanding being
supposed to exist with the Danes, I had occasion to inquire on this
subject the day before yesterday of M. d'Engeström, who is the new
minister for foreign affairs here, and who assured me that the Danish
government was even so pettish as to prevent the passage of the
Hamburgh Gazette for some time back. The Russian government has
demanded the exclusion of our ships from Swedish ports, and on this
and other conditions have agreed to receive Baron Stedinck as
negotiator: this they have informed me of, and at the same time of
their intention to negotiate upon this point, and to gain further
time. Delay is what they covet in appearance, and what in reality
appears to be their interest to desire until the campaign in Germany
is decided; for on it depends most probably the portion they will lose
of territory, and the question even of their independence as regards
their conduct towards us.</p>

<p>In the character of the Duke of Sudermania, who was created King on
Thursday the 6th, I confess also that I place much confidence, more
perhaps than in that of his ministers. His conduct has been loyal and
frank, nor does he seem to exhibit that pliability in principles too
common among this nation.</p>

<p>I have not time to copy the enclosure which I send you on the subject
of pilots, which Vice-admiral Stedinck has just written out before me,
as the post goes in an hour and a half; nor shall I perhaps have time
to write to Admiral Bertie as I could wish, this being post-day for
England.</p>

<p>Two ships of the line and a frigate are arrived off Dalarö, with 2,000
some hundred troops, and 500 sailors; and twenty-four gun-boats set
out the day before yesterday from here: fourteen more follow to-morrow
or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> next day. A camp is to be formed at Upsala of 10,000 or 12,000
men; they mean to treat armed at least, which shows spirit. A Baron
Taube has been sent to St. Petersburg to ask for passports for Baron
Stedinck: he went the day before yesterday, and cannot be back under
fifteen days.</p>

<p>The Russians are now said to have only about eighty-six gun-boats at
Åland, but 11,000 men, and to be taking measures to defend themselves
against you: one of the ships of the line is going back to Carlscrona;
and a frigate, the Freya, I think. The report that the Swedish
harbours would be shut against us on the 14th, must be attributed to
the fears of the merchants, I suppose, who are nervous in such a
precarious state of things as the present.</p>

<p class="right">Victory, off Carlscrona, 15th June 1809.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I yesterday had the honour to receive your letter of the 9th instant,
and although I was before perfectly convinced of the good disposition
of the present government of Sweden towards our country, and of the
sincerity of the Duke of Sudermania's intentions, I could not do
otherwise than make you acquainted with the surmises of the two
officers next in rank to me in the fleet. Your letter has perfectly
removed any doubts that would have existed upon the subject, and I
should place the same dependence in the Swedes as at the time of our
alliance with them: the longer they are enabled to protract the
negotiation with the Russian government, the more favourable will be
the conditions of peace they are likely to obtain, as Russia will lose
much of her ascendancy should Buonaparte be defeated by the arms of
Austria.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>The different accounts I receive from the Continent state
that the French army has been very considerably reduced by the late
actions, and that it is considered to be in a most critical situation.
A messenger, who arrived yesterday on board the Victory, charged with
despatches from Mr. Bathurst, informed me that, subsequently to the
brilliant victory of the 23rd, there had been several actions, though
of less importance; they had all terminated in favour of the Austrian
troops. The messenger left Baden on the 4th instant; and described in
the strongest terms the high spirits of the whole army, and the hopes
formed that the next action would prove decisive, and annihilate the
French.</p>

<p>I shall have great pleasure in transmitting to you any accounts I may
receive of importance; and I return you my sincere thanks for the
Gazette you did me the favour to enclose to me in your letter of the
6th. I beg leave to congratulate you on the splendid success that has
attended the army in Portugal.</p>

<p>On the approach of the Victory off the harbour of Carlscrona, the
Admiral wrote the following complimentary letter to Admiral Puké, who
was then commander-in-chief and senior admiral in the Swedish service:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">His Majesty's ship Victory, off Carlscrona,<br />
4th June 1809.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>It is with the highest satisfaction that I have the honour to inform
your excellency of my arrival off Carlscrona,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> being in my way up the
Baltic, with part of the fleet under my command, for the defence of
Sweden against the attack of the Russian fleet, and that I shall use
every possible effort to preserve the good understanding that has for
so many years subsisted between our respective nations.</p>

<p>I shall be thankful to your excellency for any information you will
be pleased to honour me with that can tend to the advancement of the
great and good cause in which we are engaged; and I am happy in
profiting by the present opportunity to transmit an official bulletin
which I received last Friday, giving an account of a most important
victory over the French army, commanded by Buonaparte in person. This
glorious event, it is to be hoped, will unite the powers in the
northern parts of the Continent totally to extirpate the atrocious
tyrant, who has been so long the scourge of the human race.</p>

<p class="left45">I have the honour to be,<br />

<p class="right smcap">James Saumarez.</p>
<p>Vice-admiral Puké, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.<br />

<p>To which Admiral Puké returned the following answer:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Carlscrona, 7th June 1809.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I felicitate myself very much on being so happy as to have occasion of
renewing with your excellency the acquaintance I was favoured with the
last year. Your excellency's flattering letter of the 4th instant gave
me a very agreeable remembrance of it; and I may give my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> hearty
acknowledgments therefore, as also for the news your excellency was
pleased to annex.</p>

<p>The post arrived a short time ago from Stockholm, and did not contain
any thing of importance, but that matters stand well. The German mail
has not come, and, in general, the news was so contradictory that
nobody knew what to believe.</p>

<p>All our forces on the southern coast being in the necessity to be
drawn up to the northern parts of the country for repelling the attack
of the Russians, the coasts on this side will be without sufficient
defence. It is only in your excellency I may fix my confidence,
convinced as I am by the good intelligence that subsists between both
nations, and his Britannic Majesty's benevolence towards Sweden, your
excellency will not omit to protect, as far as possible, the trade
from Gothenburg and through the Baltic, and prevent all hostile
enterprises.</p>

<p>I should wish to have some of such gun-brigs as your excellency can
allow, and other small vessels, to send up to the Finnish Gulf, where
they would be of no little service.</p>

<p>I include myself in your excellency's friendship, which I shall be
very proud to possess; and wish no better than that your excellency,
with all your brave officers and men, with their usual success, may
frustrate the enemy's projects against us. It is with these sincere
sentiments,</p>

<p class="left50">I have the honour to remain, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">Johan af Puké.</p></div>

<p>At Carlscrona Sir James received intelligence of the fate of the
unfortunate Major Schill, who had taken possession of Stralsund; but
whose corps of 6,000, as well as himself, were surprised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> by a large
body of Danish and Dutch troops and cut to pieces. These accounts, and
a demand for bomb vessels to assist the Swedish flotilla, were sent to
the Admiralty.</p>

<p>In consequence of a solicitation from Baron Stedinck, the Swedish
Minister of Marine expressed the high satisfaction of the Duke Regent
at the arrangement Sir James had made, not only for the protection of
the coasts of Sweden on the south, east, and west, but for his
undertaking to proceed up the Gulf of Finland, to prevent the sailing
of the Russian fleet, with his own powerful squadron.</p>

<p>On the 6th of June, the Duke of Sudermania was elected King by the
States, and took the title of Charles XIII, on which occasion due
notice was given to the Admiral both by Mr. Foster and the Swedish
Minister for Foreign Affairs, Baron Engeström. At this time everything
seemed to go well on the Continent, and the period of the new King's
accession to the throne was thought a proper epoch to sue for peace
with Russia. This, however, was not done without the knowledge of Mr.
Foster, to whom assurances were given that the alliance with England
should not be broken; and in this the King subsequently showed great
firmness. An officer was sent to demand passports for Baron Stedinck,
who was to be the negotiator, and who actually proceeded to the Gulf
of Finland. But the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> Emperor of Russia, acting under the influence or
fear of Buonaparte, made the shutting of their ports against the
English a preliminary concession before he would either grant a
passport to the negotiator, or a cessation of hostilities. The
attempt, which was indeed intended to gain time until the war between
Austria and France was decided, totally failed, and nothing was left
but to prosecute the war.</p>

<p>An attack on Åland, which had been meditated, was abandoned; and the
plan now was to cut off a division of the Russian army, which had
advanced to Urneo, in West Bothnia, for which extraordinary exertions
were made. In the meantime the Russians, amounting to 11,000, with 84
gun-boats, had, in dread of the approach of the Admiral's fleet,
fortified themselves strongly in Åland, which could not safely be
approached by ships of the line.</p>

<p>Prince William of Orange, who had brought the intelligence from
Colberg of the fate of Major Schill, and been hospitably received on
board the Victory, wrote the following letter, which Sir James
received off Carlscrona:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur</span>,&mdash;Arrivé à Gothenburg, je m'empresse de remercier votre
excellence de toutes ses bontés pour nous, et des facilités qu'elle
nous a procurées pour continuer notre voyage. Je prends la liberté de
joindre ici une lettre à M. Schroeder qui en renferme une autre à ma
mere à Berlin; priant votre excellence de la faire parvenir à Colberg
si<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> elle en a occasion, je lui en aurai une grande obligation. Je suis
avec une parfaite consideration,</p>

<p class="left50">De votre excellence, le très devoué Serviteur,</p>
<p class="right smcap">Guillaume, Prince d'Orange.</p>
<p>Gothenburg, 6 Mai 1809.<br />
Monsieur le Vice-amiral Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>The Victory left Carlscrona on the 20th June, having ten sail of the
line in company, and proceeded to the Gulf of Finland, in order to
blockade the Russian fleet at Cronstadt. Sir James chose a position at
the small island of Nargue, near Revel, as the most convenient place:
on passing Landsort, at the entrance of Stockholm, he sent the Rose
with letters, and to receive any which Mr. Foster might have for him.</p>

<p>The coronation of the new King was to take place on the 29th June. It
was the intention of his Majesty to invite Sir James to assist at that
ceremony, had he anchored at Dalerö, the anchorage for ships of the
line near the entrance of the river of Stockholm; but the Admiral had
proceeded without anchoring, and on that day was off Hang Udd.</p>

<p>On arriving at Nargue Island, which had a Russian governor, but no
fortification, Sir James found a large quantity of wood prepared for
transportation to Revel, which was very acceptable to the fleet; but
the water was not plentiful. The inhabitants of this island, who are
fishermen and speak the Swedish language, are inoffensive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> people; and
the Admiral, on his arrival, signified that it was not his intention
to molest them.</p>

<p>A correspondence was established between Mr. Foster and Sir James by
means of small vessels; and he was informed from time to time of the
progress of the negotiation with Russia, which was now going on, but
which, as we have already stated, entirely failed. It was proposed
that Baron Platen, one of the most talented men in Sweden, should
proceed to the Victory to confer with Sir James, and decide on some
plan of co-operation against the common enemy. Having received this
proposal from Mr. Foster, Sir James sent the Rose to convey the Baron
to the Victory.</p>

<p>Captain Mansell, of the Rose, was the bearer of the following letter:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Victory, off Nargue Island, 11th July 1809.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>By the Mary cutter, which arrived yesterday, I received your letters
of the 2nd and 4th inst. marked <i>private</i> and <i>confidential</i>; and I
return you thanks for the important communication you have been
pleased to make to me of the rejection by Russia of the proposed
armistice with Sweden, and of the intended plan of the latter to
transport a force to Wasa to co-operate with General Wrede, and
endeavour to force the Russian troops in West Bothnia to capitulate,
which I sincerely hope will be attended with the desired success.</p>

<p>I have not seen Baron Platen yet; but, should he put in execution his
intention of running to the squadron, I shall readily attend to any
proposal he makes to me respecting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> a small part of the force under my
orders being stationed off the Åland Haf, although the services in the
Gulf of Finland occupy all the forces I can muster.</p>

<p>I remember to have had the honour of making the Baron's acquaintance,
who appeared to me to be a clever and well-informed man. Be pleased to
convey to him the information that, should he honour me with a visit,
Captain Mansell has my directions to receive him on board, and that I
shall be happy to concert with him any measures he may suggest for the
defence of Sweden.</p>

<p>You will be happy to hear of the success that has attended a
detachment of this fleet under the command of Captain Martin, of the
Implacable, in an attack on the Russian flotilla, by the boats of that
ship, the Bellerophon, Melpomene, and Prometheus, under the orders of
Lieutenant Hawkey, who succeeded in boarding and carrying off six
gun-boats, besides one sunk, and a convoy of vessels, fourteen in
number, which were also captured, laden with stores and provisions for
the Russian troops. It is with concern I have now to state the loss of
Lieutenant Hawkey, who conducted that attack; and Lieutenant Stirling
of the Prometheus, Mr. Mountenay, a midshipman, besides ten men killed
and thirty-seven wounded.</p>

<p>The Implacable and Melpomene had, previously to this, nearly captured
a large Russian frigate off Högland; but she escaped to Aspö, and,
with four other ships of war, proceeded between the rocks to
Frederickshamn. On the following day they captured nine vessels laden
with naval stores belonging to the Emperor, which they fell in with in
Narva Bay.</p>

<p>I anchored here last Sunday in expectation of procuring a supply of
wood and water; of the former I found an abundance, which had been
ready prepared for the Emperor's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> troops at Revel, but was
disappointed in being able to obtain but a small supply of water.</p>

<p>I am in anxious expectation of receiving favourable accounts from the
armies. If Napoleon can but be defeated, the cause of Sweden will be
materially benefited, and the Emperor of Russia kept within proper
bounds.</p>

<p class="left65">I am, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">James Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>One of the first acts of his Swedish Majesty after his coronation was
to put into execution the intention of the former sovereign, by
conferring on Sir James the Grand Cross of the honourable military
order of the Sword for his past meritorious service. This was
communicated to him in the handsomest manner; but the honour could not
of course be accepted without the permission of his own sovereign,
which, on application, was most graciously accorded.</p>

<p>The news of the triumph of the British squadron over the Russian
flotilla occasioned great rejoicing in Sweden, and inspired the nation
with new spirit and courage: congratulations were sent from all
quarters. Baron Platen sailed in the Rose from Dalerö on the 20th, and
came on board the Victory on the morning of the 23rd under a salute of
seven guns.</p>

<p>In a letter to Mr. Foster, Sir James says:</p>

<p>"Since the attack upon the gun-boats, not a vessel has been seen upon
the coast; and I hope effectually to prevent any supplies getting to
the Russian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> troops in Finland excepting over land, which must tend to
retard all their operations exceedingly.</p>

<p>"I have had this day (23rd July) a great deal of conversation with
Baron Platen upon the actual state of affairs, and I feel perfectly
disposed to give every assistance which the too limited means (owing
to the various services required for my whole force) will admit. He
informs me that the service is not likely to be of any continuance.</p>

<p>"I have ordered the Tribune, with the Rose and a gun-brig, to cruise
in Åland Haf. The Tribune is a frigate of the largest class, which I
can ill spare at present. Captain Reynolds will be directed to
communicate with you, and I request you will furnish him with all such
information as he may occasionally profit from.</p>

<p>"Baron Platen has brought me the decorations of Commander of the Grand
Cross of the order of the Sword, a mark of distinction I by no means
considered my services to have merited; and I feel sensibly this
instance of attention from the King of Sweden. The choice fixed upon
for successor to the throne is likely to lead to important events, as
it is probable the Prince of Holstein will have influence enough in
Norway to attach that country to Sweden, which would make up for the
loss of Finland."</p>

<p>The part of the campaign which depended on Sir James Saumarez, namely,
the blockade of the Russian fleet, which consisted of thirteen sail of
the line,&mdash;the protection of the coast of Sweden and of the trade of
both nations,&mdash;was completely successful. Not so, however, the efforts
of the Swedes: they indeed fought most bravely; and, if any fault
could be found with their general, it was that he was too courageous.
The force of the Russians was too great for their Swedish opponents;
and every attempt made by the latter was in vain, notwithstanding
Baron Platen's wishes were acceded to. Admiral Puké, on receiving his
appointment, left Carlscrona in a ship of the line, and, arriving off
Dalerö, wrote the following letter to Sir James:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">His Majesty's ship Adolf Frederick,<br />
off Dalerö, 2d Aug. 1809.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I do myself the honour to inform your excellency that his Swedish
Majesty has most graciously been pleased to intrust to me the command
of his sea and land forces, who are to act on the coasts and in the
Gulf of Bothnia against the common enemy of our respective nations;
and I beg to assure your excellency that nothing could afford me more
pleasure than receiving your commands, if ever I can be of the
smallest use to your excellency. I submit to your excellency's own
judgment if it should not be useful to the common service to have
respective officers, who are acquainted with the languages, placed
aside of the commanders-in-chief. For my part, I should find it very
agreeable if Lieutenant John Ross, who served last year on board the
Swedish Admiral's ship, would be permitted to resume the same
employment on board of this. He is so well acquainted with the Swedish
language and customs, that I flatter myself he would have no objection
to this proposition.</p>

<p>If winds permit, I intend to depart to-morrow with two ships, one
frigate, six galleys, fifty gun-boats, and some transports, carrying
7,000 troops, and proceed up the Gulf in order to debark this army on
a proper place, so that they might fall in the back and destroy the
enemy's troops, who at present occupy the province of West Bothnia.
Vice-admiral Baron Cederstrom will remain with one hundred gun-boats
and some galleys to protect the Swedish coasts opposite Åland. The
Camilla frigate is left cruising in the Åland Haf, to act in
conjunction with the British force stationed there by the orders of
your excellency.</p>

<p>I should think it very useful for the service we are upon if a British
frigate and some sloops of war could be stationed at Revel, in order
to prevent the enemy from sending any reinforcement to Åland; and also
if your excellency<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> should proceed further up in the Gulf of Finland
with the British squadron, and make such demonstrations as would
contribute to keep the enemy in uncertainty of an attack on either of
the coasts in the Gulf. He would thereby be obliged to disperse his
forces, which in the present case would be of the greatest utility for
the service.</p>

<p>I submit all this to your excellency's invaluable judgment, and have
the honour to remain, with the highest esteem and consideration,</p>

<p class="left50">Sir,<br />
<span class="i1">Your excellency's</span><br />

<p>The Swedish councillor of state, Baron Platen, who had been sent to
communicate with Sir James, remained only a few days on board the
Victory, when it was agreed that the Swedish flotilla should be
reinforced, so that there could be no doubt left of its superiority to
that of the Russians. The following correspondence will demonstrate
the amicable feeling produced by the interview.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Stockholm, 2d August 1809.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>It is with great pleasure I have the honour to return my best thanks
for all the numberless civilities bestowed on me during my last visit.
I should be vain were I to consider these as paid to me personally;
they were given in honour of my King and country, so powerfully
protected by your excellency, for which his Majesty has ordered me to
express his highest gratitude.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> In reference to the operations in the
common cause, as well as to some other matters, I have written to
Captain Hope, to whom I sent several charts and drawings. I hope he
will make out what I mean, though I cannot express my ideas as I wish

<p>Part of the expedition to the north is already under way, and the rest
will to-morrow set off under the command of Admiral Puké. May the
Almighty crown the undertaking with success, and soon send them back
again! Perhaps something might be effected, before bad weather puts a
stop to operations, with the small fleet. Till now, every event seems
favourable to the expedition; and the knowledge of the chief makes me
confident that what is possible will be done. How much will Sweden be
indebted to your excellency for having so powerfully promoted the
business by combined measures.</p>

<p>I rejoice in the opportunity this gives me to assure your excellency
of the high esteem wherewith I am for ever,</p>

Admiral Puké.</p>

<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>With the greatest pleasure I have received the letter your excellency
has done me the honour to write, and I have to express my sincerest
regret at not having been able to enjoy for a longer time your
valuable company on board the Victory; but when I considered how
precious every hour must be to your excellency at this important
epoch,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> I could not prevail upon myself to offer the least delay to
your departure, however happy it would have made me to postpone it for
some days longer.</p>

<p>I hope soon to have the satisfaction to be informed that the
expedition has been crowned with the most complete success; and should
the proposed enterprise against Åland be adopted, I trust to be able
to reinforce the detachment under the orders of Captain Reynolds, and
contribute, as far as my means will admit, to an expedition that has
the security of Sweden for its object.</p>

<p>I return you my sincere thanks for the charts you have been pleased to
send to Captain Hope, and for the attention your excellency has
bestowed on the welfare of the squadron in directing that the ships
may be supplied with fresh provisions from the island of Gothland,
should they require it.</p>

<p>The unremitted marks of friendship and regard shown to the fleet under
my command in the different ports in Sweden have excited my highest
gratitude, and I have not failed to express the same to my government.</p>

<p>I shall take the earliest opportunity to signify to Mr. Ross, who is
at this time absent from the squadron on a particular service, the
distinguished mark of favour his Majesty the King of Sweden has been
pleased to confer upon him for his services.</p>

<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I received by the Mary your letter of the 10th, with the papers to the
1st instant from London. I hope the next accounts will convey the
pleasing information of the complete success of the expedition under
Lord Chatham, and that so powerful a blow in favour of the common
cause will induce Austria to renew hostilities against Bonaparte. I
shall also be happy to hear that the expedition to the Gulf of Bothnia
has been terminated by the expulsion of the whole of the Russian force
from Sweden. Nothing has transpired in these quarters since my last
letter. From what I am informed, great discontent prevails in Russia
at the conduct of Bonaparte with respect to Poland.</p>

<p>In my last letter from England, orders have been given for the vessels
that conveyed the Spanish troops from the Danish islands to Gottenburg
to be restored. This looks as if peace was about to take place between
Sweden and Denmark; and I am informed by Mr. Merry it was a condition
demanded by Denmark previously to preliminaries being entered into.</p>

<p class="right">Victory, Gulf of Finland, 22nd August 1809.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I return you many thanks for the letters and despatches you have been
pleased to forward to me, and which, with your letter of the 19th,
reached me yesterday evening. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> becomes of so great importance that
I should receive my several communications as speedily as possible,
that I lose no time in hastening the cutter back to Dalarö, and I
shall be obliged to you to transmit my letters for England that I send
by her.</p>

<p>I have this morning received a letter from Berlin, dated the 30th
ultimo, from a person who had recently left the Austrian
head-quarters. It was expected that hostilities would be renewed at
the expiration of the armistice, and measures were ordered to be in
readiness for that purpose. I also understand that information of this
being the intention of the Emperor has been transmitted to government,
and also to Lord Chatham, commanding the expedition. I therefore hope
we may yet see a favourable termination of the campaign.</p>

<p>With respect to Sweden, I am really anxious to be informed what are
the intentions of ministers relative to that country, as also if there
exists any probability of their concluding peace with Russia and the
other powers.</p>

<p>On receiving the account of the insurrection on the Earthholmes, I
sent immediate orders to his Majesty's ships that might be at
Carlscrona to use their endeavours to take possession of them, and I
have detached a ship of the line upon that service. It is an island of
great importance, and I sincerely hope it will fall into our hands. I
also hope to receive accounts of the expedition from Sweden having
succeeded to its fullest extent, and request you will be pleased to
transmit to me the earliest accounts that may arrive. I am rather
surprised at not having heard from the detachment under Captain
Reynolds.</p>

<p>Admiral Puké, having been reinforced by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> Tribune, Rose, Hearty,
and some gun-boats, proceeded safely to his destination at West
Bothnia. In every attack on the Russian flotilla he had the advantage,
and he eventually landed General Count Wachtmeister with 7,000 troops
near Umeö. It appears that this general did not take up the best
position for preventing the escape of the Russian general Kaminski,
who, notwithstanding the bravery of the Swedish troops in the battle
of Umeö, succeeded in effecting a retreat on a reinforcement, and at
length compelled the Swedish general to propose an armistice on the
terms dictated by Russia. This led to a peace, by which Russia
obtained the whole of Finland and West Bothnia as far as Umeö.</p>

<p>The terms would no doubt have been still worse had not the English
fleet remained in the Gulf, for there was nothing else to prevent the
Russians from taking possession of Stockholm. It will be manifest,
from the following correspondence, that, under circumstances of heavy
responsibility, Sir James remained to a very late period for the
defence of Sweden and the protection of the commerce of that country
and England.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Stockholm, 2d Sept. 1809.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I had the honour to receive yesterday your excellency's letter, dated
28th ultimo. Despatches and letters have been lying here for you some
days: in those which came yesterday you will find the official account
of the surrender of Flushing. I am sorry not to be able to give you
such satisfactory intelligence as I could wish of the operations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> of
the Swedes, who have failed to cut off the retreat of the enemy,
although they have gained considerable advantages. I enclose to you
the Swedish Gazette, as I think you have an officer on board who can
read it.</p>

<p>I delivered to Baron Platen your message. He is, however, quite
despondent as to the possibility now of an attack upon Åland. Count
&mdash;&mdash;, it really appears, might have taken a stronger
position, so as to prevent the escape of Kaminski. The time that will
now be lost in his pursuit being fatal, renders future operations
equally so.</p>

<p>The Baron means to write to you, and I shall detain the King's
messenger Meares; whom, not having anybody else to send, I am obliged
to despatch to Dalerö until this letter is ready.</p>

<p>The negotiation at Frederickshamn, as far as I can understand, is
proceeding slowly. The demands of Russia continue peremptory, as
before, upon the cessions required. On the article respecting us, some
propositions of a modifying nature have been offered by the Russians;
such as though the general preliminary for excluding from Swedish
ports is still insisted on, that colonial goods, salt, and raw produce
of various kinds, amounting to almost every thing that is not actually
prohibited by the Swedish laws, shall be considered as exceptions. But
on the question of the ships, and particularly of the ships of war of
Great Britain, I am afraid, in the present state of things, that
Sweden will not obtain a peace without a stipulation for their
exclusion.</p>

<p>Under this conviction I have addressed myself to Baron Engerstrom,
representing to him the danger that his Majesty's ships might be
exposed to in keeping the seas at the perilous season of the year if
no ports were open to them; and I requested of him to give me early
intelligence if Sweden were disposed to consent to this article, and
as to when it might be put into execution. The Swedish minister gave
me the most solemn assurances that he would not fail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> to communicate
to me full time enough if this country should be obliged to enter into
such stipulations; and observed that, although necessity might oblige
them to act against their wishes, yet that they would <i>always be
honest</i>. He likewise remarked that preliminary conditions were not at
any rate to be put in force until the peace was ratified; and that,
before that event should take place, arrangements were to be entered
into relative to the ceded provinces, which would necessarily cause a
very considerable delay; so that he would not look upon a final
arrangement with Russia as being likely to ensue before the winter
should set in, and render navigation impracticable.</p>

<p>The Swedish minister has frequently remarked to me, that, even if a
treaty should be signed by which Sweden should bind herself to exclude
us from her ports, such an obligation could only extend to those that
were capable of defence; but that there were innumerable inlets and
harbours which were not commanded by cannon, and which of course could
not be included. One of the propositions to be put forward will, I
have reason to think, be grounded upon this state of the coasts; and
it will be offered to close the large harbours, mentioning them by
name, leaving the rest open. I should be glad to know what you think
of these speculations of the Swedish cabinet on so interesting a
point. If the Earthholmes are taken, I suppose you will not be very
anxious about them. I forward to you two German papers from Mr.
Fenwick, and two of Pelletier's papers, which you may like to see, and
have an occasion to forward to Mr. Drusina. The Hamburg Gazette says
the armistice is broken in Germany, and there are reports of two
battles.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p class="right">Victory, Gulf of Finland, 8th Sept. 1809.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I had the honour to receive yesterday your letter of the 2nd inst.,
and I am truly concerned to find the success of the Swedish expedition
has been so very inadequate to what was reasonably to have been
expected, and that the delay in endeavouring to cut off the retreat of
the Russian troops will render it too late to make the intended attack
upon Åland. The terms persisted in by Russia appear to be very severe;
but I apprehend Sweden will be obliged to make the most of them, from
the slender means she has of defending herself during the winter
months, when the country will be exposed to danger of an invasion. It
is a fortunate circumstance that the navigation has been so long
protracted as to enable the trade to proceed hitherto out of the
Baltic, and as considerable delay must still take place before the
peace can be ratified, it will afford sufficient time for the ships
that are loading in the Russian ports to assemble at Carlscrona before
the exclusion can be enforced. The period agreed upon for the last
convoy to sail from Carlscrona was fixed to the 15th Nov., till which
time, at least, we must hope the ports will be open, both to ships of
war and the trade. Should you think it advisable, it might be
mentioned to the Swedish minister (Baron Engerstrom) that if the
stipulation of exclusion is absolutely insisted upon, that it is hoped
that it will not be put in force till the winter is too far advanced
to admit any ships sailing from the ports of Russia.</p>

<p>It will be proper to know from Baron Engerstrom if the notice that was
signified in the spring, of not allowing more than five or six
pendants at a time at Carlscrona or other ports in Sweden, is insisted
upon at present, in order that I may regulate myself accordingly. At
the same time, as tempestuous weather in going down the Baltic, or
other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> circumstances, may render it advisable for the whole squadron
to enter Carlscrona, I would wish orders to be given for that purpose,
and that the pilots may be directed to go out to ships making the
signal. I shall be obliged to you to let me know by the return of this
vessel the determination of the Swedish government upon this point.</p>

<p>It is my wish to remain in the Gulf of Finland as long as is possible,
consistent with the safety of his Majesty's ships; but as the
equinoctial gales may soon be expected, and as it will become
indispensable to withdraw the ships, particularly those stationed in
Makelato Bay, I could wish to be informed whether it becomes of
importance to Sweden for the squadron to remain in this sea any
longer, and which I also request you will let me know, by the return
of the vessel that conveys this, with as little delay as possible. I
forward some papers I yesterday received from Pillau; you will find
the armistice has been prolonged for a fortnight with fourteen days'
warning, but it was expected hostilities would re-commence the middle
of the present month.</p>

<p>I sincerely congratulate you upon the surrender of Flushing. I hope we
shall soon hear that the other objects of the expedition have been
accomplished, particularly as far as regards the capture or
destruction of the enemy's ships in the Scheldt. I delivered to
Captain Ross the Cross of the Order of the Sword, which was enclosed
to me by Count de Mörner. He will be happy to avail himself of this
signal mark of distinction, on receiving his Majesty's gracious
permission. Permit me to request your having the goodness to forward
the enclosed to Count Mörner.</p>

<p class="right">Stockholm, Sept. 7th, 1809.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>Your private letter of the 5th inst. has reached me with extraordinary
despatch. By this time you will, I trust, have had mine of the 2nd: I
have nothing to add to the statement I then made to you of the
appearance of affairs in Sweden, except that an armistice has been
offered by General Kaminski, which will probably be accepted. Platen
is in great despondency, and says he never will be sanguine about
anything again. The generals have certainly not done as they might. As
far as the council and the navy were concerned, all was well combined,
but the army was ill posted, and Wachtmeister has shown that he has
but a very poor head. Unless the Russians are disposed to change
sides, the negotiation at Frederickshamn is not likely to be benefited
by these events. You must calculate on this country yielding, if the
ministers are pressed strongly, to the terms demanded. I see no means
they have of resisting. It is a mutilated land, and the resources that
remain are ill managed, while the debt is rapidly increasing.</p>

<p>Baron de Platen desires me to say he will send you the plan you
demanded of St. Petersburg by the next opportunity; it is copying, and
not quite ready. I have the honour to send to you a couple of the last
French papers. Lieut. Allen delivered to me your letter, and I shall
endeavour to get him a seat in the messengers' carriage to-morrow
night.</p>

<p>I should be glad to know when you think of quitting the Gulf with the
fleet, and how soon the navigation becomes dangerous. If an armistice
between the hostile armies in West Bothnia takes place, in all
probability the squadron in Åland's Haf will be no longer necessary
there.</p>

<p class="left65">I have, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">Augt. Foster.</p>

<p>To Vice-admiral Sir James Saumarez.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I send you a paper of the
26th, a day later than any here, which I have got from the packets
having been detained a day in Harwich. I hope you will be able to send
the French papers to Mr. Drusina. I beg to submit the suggestion of
the advantage of as frequent a return of the despatch vessel to
Dalero, at this period, as is convenient to you.</p>

<p>The armistice between France and Austria appears to have been
prolonged, some say twenty-eight days, some eighteen: it is said
proposals have been made to us. I can think of none that would be
palatable.</p>
<hr class="c15" />

<p class="right">Stockholm, 15th Sept. 1809.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>On the day before yesterday Mr. Reynolds delivered to me your letters
of the 8th and 9th inst, as also a despatch containing three letters
addressed to me from Pillau, for which I beg to return you my best
thanks. I had already taken occasion, some days back, to prepare Baron
d'Engeström for the moment, when, in consequence of the lateness of
the season, a formal notification might be made to him, on your part,
of the impossibility of your much longer keeping the seas you are in;
and I lost no time in soliciting an interview of the Swedish Minister
for the purpose of obtaining from him the information which you desire
in your letter above mentioned.</p>

<p>I stated to his excellency that you were anxious to know whether it
became of importance to Sweden that the squadron under your orders
should remain in the sea in which it is any time longer. I laid stress
upon the circumstance that the only object which you now had in
remaining in the Gulf of Finland was the defence of Sweden, and to
cover the expedition in West Bothnia; and I did not fail to remark
upon the season being advanced, and the dangers to which his Majesty's
ships might be exposed by a longer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> stay in the Gulf of Finland,
though at the same time I thought it advisable to dwell upon the
sincere wish which I was sure you had to do everything in your power,
short of endangering the safety of the fleet, that might be judged
desirable by the Swedish Government for the further defence of this
country.</p>

<p>Baron d'Engeström asked to consult his sovereign upon the answer to be
made, and yesterday he appointed an hour in the evening for me to wait
upon him. I had previously written to him in the morning a letter of
which the enclosed is a copy, from the warmth with which he assured me
that at all events, and under whatever stipulations, peace might be
made between Sweden and her enemies. His Majesty's ships under your
command, to whose efforts Sweden was so much indebted, should have no
reason to dread the result, or your excellency have cause to be
anxious, lest an article for the exclusion of British ships from the
Swedish ports should be suddenly enforced, even if Sweden were finally
to be under the necessity of agreeing to a treaty containing it. I was
afraid that the Swedish Minister might labour under the mistake of
imagining that a suspicion of such a state of things being likely to
take place, might possibly be connected with your desire to withdraw
from the Gulf of Finland at the present moment, and I therefore judged
it advisable, without making an official note of it, to write the
letter, a copy of which I enclose, and which I hope will meet with
your approbation.</p>

<p>On seeing the minister I found he was fully sensible of the motives by
which you were guided; he thanked you for the assistance you had given
to Sweden on the part of his sovereign, who, he said, was penetrated
with the delicacy of your conduct to this country. If you could not
keep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> your station in the narrow Gulf of Finland, he hoped that you
might be able to remain at least in the Baltic, until the accounts
from Fredericksham should become more decided; and as to the squadron
in Åland Haf, he observed, that Admiral Puké was soon expected, when
the service of that squadron would no longer be wanted; he wished it
to remain till then, which would be a few days longer.</p>

<p>As I had demanded, in conformity with your desire, if the regulation
of last spring, which limited the number of his Majesty's pendants
that might be in Carlscrona or other ports of Sweden, was still to be
considered in force, he answered me, that with respect to the ships
under your orders, any number of them, or all, might enter into
Carlscrona or any other port, and procure what they stood in need of;
and he offered to give me a written engagement to that effect, which I
expressed a desire to have, and it is for that I wait in order to
despatch the Hero.</p>

<p class="right">Stockholm, Sept. 16th, 1809.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>Lieut. Reynolds having been so long detained, without entering into
particulars, I shall only mention that peace is on the point of being
signed between Sweden and Russia; an officer arrived yesterday from
Fredericksham, and on the 18th or 20th the signature is expected. The
exclusion of British ships and merchandise is one of the articles; but
those under your command, and the merchant ships now in the Baltic or
at Gottenburg, M. d'Engeström has assured me, are to be excepted from
its operations.</p>

<p>I have the honour to enclose to you a copy of the note which I have
this moment received from the Swedish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> minister, in answer to the
propositions you had made. The minister remarked to me, that though he
should not mention it in the note, yet that he trusted you, in using
the ports of Sweden, would be cautious of committing the government of
Sweden. Both he and Baron Platen are desirous that you should still
keep the sea near the Gulf of Finland, in order to influence their
negotiation; certain British goods are still to be admitted. I shall
despatch a messenger to Captain Reynolds the moment Admiral Puké
arrives.</p>

<p class="right">Victory, off Nargen, 19th Sept. 1809.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I had the honour yesterday evening to receive your letters of the 15th
and 16th inst., enclosing the copy of one you had written to Baron
d'Engeström, and of that minister's answer to your letter. It affords
me great satisfaction to find that the Swedish government have so
readily acquiesced in the representation you were pleased to make to
them of the expediency of the squadron leaving the Gulf of Finland, in
consequence of the present advanced state of the season, and also of
the ready concurrence with the proposal that all the squadron, if
required, should be admitted into the ports of Sweden, without
adverting to the number that had been previously limited.</p>

<p>I request you will do me the honour to assure Baron d'Engeström, that
I shall not withdraw the squadron from this station until the weather
renders it indispensable for the safety of his Majesty's ships, and
that, on my leaving the Gulf, I shall order a detachment to cruise
between Daggerort and the Swedish coast, should it be further
required. It is a fortunate circumstance that the preliminaries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> of
peace were so far advanced as not to give a pretext for their being
hastened by the squadron having been withdrawn from the station, and
it affords me singular satisfaction to find that the government
appears so strongly impressed with the measures that have been pursued
for the welfare of Sweden.</p>

<p>I shall detach vessels as frequently as possible to maintain the
correspondence, and I beg to express my sincere acknowledgments for
the punctuality you have shown in permitting me to hear from you by
all opportunities that have offered.</p>

<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>According to your desire I shall not detain Lieut. Reynolds. I have
the honour to acknowledge the receipt from him of your letters of the
24th, 25th, 26th, and 28th ult., with their enclosures, which I have
delivered as directed. I have given in charge to him your letters
which came by the last two mails, bringing our accounts from London to
the 19th ult. Another may be expected to-morrow or next day, as the
wind was fair at Gottenburg; and according to your wish I shall
forward whatever may come to your address by express to Carlscrona. I
return you my best thanks for the newspapers and letter from
Koningsburg and Pillau, which you were so good as to forward to me.</p>

<p>I have now received the assurances of the Swedish government that
British ships of every kind will be received into the Swedish ports
until after the 12th of November, the time fixed by them for putting
into execution the stipulations contained in the 3rd article of their
treaty of peace with Russia. This article does not at all refer to the
departure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> from Swedish ports of British ships, and therefore I
conclude, as I am indeed warranted by the declarations of the ministry
here, that the sailing of convoys from Sweden may continue up to any
period of the year, but the English flag may not enter any port of the
country after the 12th of November; you will, of course, be best able
to judge how this will agree with your arrangements.</p>

<p>I had several days ago spoken to Admiral <ins title="Corrected erratum: original reads 'Stedriegh'">Stedinck</ins> about orders to the
pilots to be ready at Carlscrona in case you should want any number of
them, and I received his assurances that every necessary direction
should be instantly given to that effect. The Mercurius has sailed
with the Duke of Brunswick's chests. I understand a Swedish brig is
off Dalerö to give convoy. The Hearty is not, owing to contrary winds.
I shall inquire about the periods when convoys will be required, and
let you know the results.</p>

raised some outcry on the invitation made to you to enter Carlscrona.
I can perceive even that some of the members of the government do not
wish your stay there to be long, for fear of their being committed,
and I really believe, that provisions were collected for you in
Gothland, in order to diminish the necessity of it: finding such to be
the case, I intimated to Baron Platen, whose frankness and openness on
all occasions I have the greatest cause to commend, that I would write
to you, and that I was sure you would find means to avoid entering
Carlscrona at all, if you heard that any ill-founded and unjust
suspicions were entertained of your intentions, on which he conjured
me not to do so; that on the contrary he wished you would come in, and
that it would have the happiest effect if you were to stay there with
a fleet a few days, and prove to the ill-minded that British honour
was to be trusted.</p>

<p>I cannot but think so too, and therefore I was very glad to find that
it was your intention to take at least some ships into Carlscrona. The
fleet, of transports coming from England with the Russian seamen,
described in the German papers as a formidable fleet, has also created
some alarm among the ill-informed. Harassed and torn as this country
has been, it is perhaps excusable that the people should be fearful
and nervous to excess, as to the situation of the small remaining
resources which they possess.</p>

<p>I hope to have the honour to hear from you from Carlscrona, and that
your excellency has had everything you wished there.</p>
<p class="left65">I have, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">Augt. Foster.</p>
<p>To Vice-admiral Sir James Saumarez, Bart. K.B.</p></div>

<p>During the time the fleet lay at Nargen roads the ships were not
molested by the Russians, who had marched 15,000 men to defend Revel.
The poor inhabitants on the island were liberally paid for everything
that was supplied to the fleet; some valuable trees were cut down, and
the empty transports which had brought out stores and provisions were
partly loaded with them.</p>

<p>On the 28th of September it became no longer necessary to blockade the
Russians, who had now concluded an armistice; Denmark had done the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
same. Sir James, therefore, proceeded to Carlscrona with three sail of
the line only, the <ins title="Corrected erratum: Note: original reads 'remaininig'">remaining</ins> ships being distributed in other places
where anchorage could be found.</p>

<p>During the summer, Rear-admirals Bertie and Manley Dixon had been
stationed to protect convoys, the former in the Sound, and the latter
in the Belt. Nothing of any consequence happened except the capture of
eighty men, who were surprised by a powerful body of Danes on the
small island of Romsöe, where they had been to procure wood and water.
The Minx gun-brig was taken off the coast of Norway. Anholt was placed
in a state of defence, and garrisoned by a detachment of marines from
England.</p>

<p>Having entered the harbour on the 5th October, Sir James wrote the
following letter to Mr. Foster, which states a circumstance of rather
a delicate nature, wherein he displayed both tact and prudence.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Victory, at Carlscrona, 7th October 1809.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honour to acquaint you of my arrival at Carlscrona on
Wednesday evening, with three sail of the line only, having thought it
most advisable to order the others to the Belt and off Gottenburg. The
permission to admit any number of ships was received by Vice-admiral
Baron Palmquist as I was coming into the harbour, and every possible
attention has been manifested by the Vice-admiral and all the other
Swedish officers towards the squadron, which I cannot represent in too
strong terms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> A circumstance of rather an untoward nature has
occurred, with which I think right to make you acquainted, in case any
explanation should be required. I was informed that with the order to
admit any number of his Majesty's ships, Admiral Palmquist was also
directed to invite me and the captains of the squadron to dinner on
this day, being the anniversary of the King's birth-day. Knowing that
government have not as yet acknowledged the present sovereign, it
would have been improper for me to appear on so public an occasion: I
accepted the invitation, intending to excuse myself as I might find
necessary. On Baron Palmquist returning my visit yesterday he noticed
it was the anniversary of his sovereign's birth-day. I have this
morning sent him a note to excuse myself the honour of dining with
him, on the footing that my official duties would not permit it.</p>

<p>Admiral Pickmore, Captain Hope, and all the captains dine with the
Baron. I did not think it proper to prevent this, after the great
attention paid upon every occasion to the officers of the squadron.
The motive I have before mentioned must prevent the salutes that
usually take place on similar occasions.</p>

<p>I enclose to you a despatch which I received from Pillau yesterday,
and a German paper I received by the same opportunity. It was
generally believed that hostilities would be renewed on the 5th inst.</p>

<p>The period of my remaining here is not yet fixed, but I shall have the
pleasure of informing you the moment I can decide.</p>

<p class="left65">I have, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
Nothing could surpass the kindness of the Swedes at Carlscrona, and
Sir James left them after a stay of a few weeks with sincere regret.
He proceeded through the Belt, affording protection to a large convoy,
and visiting the different stations. The order not to admit any
British ships of war or merchantmen after the 15th of November, was
dated on the 25th October; but it was considered on both sides as a
matter of form, it being notorious that the Swedes could not prevent
English men-of-war from entering any of their ports if they chose; but
out of delicacy to them, and that there should be no cause of
complaint for not fulfilling the treaty, Sir James did not occupy any
of their fortified harbours, and as little as he could the others. He
touched at Gottenburg to give his final directions about the convoys,
and at Christmas arrived and struck his flag in the Downs. Having
received the high approbation of the Lords of the Admiralty for his
judicious conduct under such extraordinary circumstances, and for the
protection so successfully afforded to the trade, he returned to his
native island, to enjoy for a few months the society of his family and
friends.</p>

<p class="p2"></p>

<p>We must now revert to the state of affairs in the central continent of
Europe, on which the fate of Sweden so materially depended.
Buonaparte, having withdrawn the greatest part of his troops from
Spain, had planted his eagles at Vienna, and, after the battles of
Aspern and Wagram, had obliged the Emperor of Austria to sue for
peace, which was concluded on the 14th October 1809; by this the whole
sea-coast had been ceded to France, and Prussia was recompensed for
her neutrality by the cession of a part of Galicia; while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> Joseph
Buonaparte was declared King of Spain, and acknowledged as such by the
Emperor of Austria, who consented to the union of his daughter, the
Arch-duchess Maria Louisa, with Buonaparte, as soon as he had divorced
his wife Josephine, an event which took place in December.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the ruler of France had proclaimed himself mediator of
Switzerland, and declared that every port in Europe should be shut
against British commerce. Early in 1810 he began to unfold his designs
upon Holland, which, he gradually occupied and annexed to France,
obliging his brother Louis to resign his throne. He subsequently took
possession of the mouths of the Scheldt, the Meuse, the Rhine, the
Weser, and the Elbe. Rome, Holland, Valais, and the Hanse Towns, with
a population of thirty-eight millions, were added to France; while
Hanover was given to the kingdom of Westphalia.</p>

<p>That the politics of Sweden should have undergone a change in
consequence of the extraordinary success of Buonaparte, can hardly
excite surprise; but another untoward circumstance took place, which
seemed to militate against a continuation of an alliance with Great
Britain, namely, the untimely death of the Danish prince, who had been
unanimously elected to succeed Charles XIII, and who, having acted in
Sweden as Crown Prince since the 21st of January 1810, had endeared
himself to the nation as well by his amiable disposition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> and the
admirable regulations he had made, as by his conduct in Norway, while
opposed to the Swedes, particularly in forbearing to attack them from
Norway, where he commanded a Danish army during the revolution. It had
been falsely and unfortunately circulated that he had been poisoned by
Count Fersen, then Riks-Marskall (prime minister) of Sweden. On the
arrival of the remains of the deceased prince at Stockholm, the Count
fell a victim to the indignation of the lawless and infuriated
populace. The following is an authentic account of that lamentable
event.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">21st June 1810.</p>

<p>All Stockholm was in an uproar! At noon, the corpse of the lamented
Crown Prince entered the city by Horngatan, escorted by only a company
of dragoons, and preceded by several members of the court, and finally
by Riks-Marskall Fersen, Fabian Fersen, and Doctor Rossi. On entering
the street, the mob began to insult the Riks-Marskall, and soon after
to throw stones and other missiles. When the windows of his carriage
were broken, the mob gave a loud hurrah. The people now followed the
carriage into Nygatan, opposite the inn called Bergstratska Husset,
into which Count Fersen jumped, already covered with blood, but
followed by the infuriated mob, who first tore off his order riband
and threw it into the street; then, having stripped him naked, they
threw him out of the window into the street. Here the mob proceeded to
beat him with clubs, and trample on him, until death put an end to his
sufferings. In the mean time, General-adjutant Silversparre and
Aldercreuts rode through the street, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> in vain talked to the
people; they had no troops, and the assistance came too late, being
only in time to preserve the lifeless body being torn to pieces.</p>

<p>The fury of the mob being now satiated, and the soldiers having fired
a few shots among them, they began to disperse, but not before many
were killed and wounded, and it is believed that the remainder of the
suite which attended the lamented Prince at his death would have
shared the same fate as Count Fersen, had the military not arrived in
time to save them. The body of Count Fersen was with difficulty
carried off on a sledge. In the night the windows of Count Ugglas and
several others were broken, and it was not until some days that
tranquillity was restored.</p></div>

<p>Buonaparte had now sent peremptory orders to enforce his commands that
the port of Sweden should be shut against British commerce, but it was
evident that these orders could never be carried into effect, unless
they had a superiority by sea. The principal ports might, indeed, be
nominally shut, but Sweden could neither prevent the British navy from
entering her numerous unfortified harbours by her own army, or support
troops sufficient for the purpose of defending them. It was therefore
only necessary to make a show of compliance, in order to satisfy the
despotic ruler of France, who had absurdly declared Great Britain to
be in a state of blockade.</p>

<p>It was under these delicate circumstances that Sir James resumed the
command of his Majesty's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> fleet in the Baltic, and having rehoisted
his flag on board the Victory on the 11th March 1810, he proceeded to
Hawke Roads, which is the outer roadstead to Gottenburg, and was
followed by Rear-admirals Reynolds, Dixon, and Morris. Before leaving
England, Sir James had communicated with Lord Mulgrave, then first
Lord of the Admiralty, on the relative situation of the two countries;
and as it was the wish of his Majesty's ministers to avoid, as long as
possible, committing any hostile act against Sweden, they confided in
the tact of Sir James to pursue the course which he judged most
advantageous to the interests of commerce, and at the same time to
uphold the honour and naval superiority of the nation. The Swedes had
already a sufficient knowledge of the British Admiral's high
character, and our government could not have afforded them a more
decisive assurance of their desire to remain on amicable terms with
them than by sending Sir James with extraordinary powers to act
according to circumstances. On the one hand, they knew that in all
matters of a delicate nature they could place the utmost reliance on
his word, and that they were treating with a person quite incapable of
deception or intrigue; on the other, they were aware that if coercion
became necessary, he would act with decision, and baffle every evasive
man&oelig;uvre.</p>

<p>The following correspondence with Mr. Foster<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> and others, with some
occasional remarks, will convey to the reader some idea of the
important and difficult situation in which Sir James was placed.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Victory, Hawke Road, 21st May 1810.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honour to acquaint your excellency of my arrival here with
part of the squadron under my command, and of my intention to proceed
into the Baltic as soon as the wind will permit. It will afford me the
highest satisfaction to renew a correspondence from whence I derived
such great benefit during the time I was employed upon this station
last year; and although the unfortunate exclusion of British ships
from the ports of Sweden will render it more difficult at this time, I
hope it will not be the means of entirely depriving me of the honour
of hearing from your excellency. As I propose calling off Ystad, on my
getting into the Baltic, I shall detach a vessel to that place for any
letters you may have done me the honour to write.</p>
<p class="left65">I have, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">James Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>The Victory arrived off Ystad on the 6th June, when Sir James received
the following letter from Mr. Foster:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right smcap">Stockholm, 25th May 1810.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I hasten to reply to the letter which you have done me the honour to
write from Gottenburg, and to return you my best thanks for the
communication of your arrival off the Swedish coast. It is with great
pleasure that I renew a correspondence which, as you are kind enough
to say, was of benefit to you last year, and from which I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> certainly
derived most important assistance, and the highest satisfaction.</p>

<p>I am afraid, however, that the opportunities of writing to you will be
few. Ystad, from its neighbourhood to Denmark, seems to be too much
exposed to observation, for this government to wink at the
correspondence passing that way. It has been hinted to me, however,
that it might proceed without difficulty through the small town of
Sölvitzborg on the frontiers of Blekingen and of Scania, and I write
to Mr. Fenwick by this day's post to recommend his making arrangements
for the purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. Consul Smith has transmitted to me a copy of an article in your
printed instructions, which he says you allowed him to make known at
Gothenburg, and which, if acted upon, will strike at the coasting
trade of this country in a manner that I scarcely think was
contemplated by Government. Indeed it appears to me, particularly when
I consider the previous notice that has regularly been given in
Sweden, where measures have been taken against his Majesty's
interests, that it will be liable to the imputation of unfairness, if
acted upon immediately, vast quantities of Swedish shipping, which was
sent to sea in the confidence of security from capture, being exposed
to its operation. I was in hopes that I should have heard from you on
the subject, and I cannot but flatter myself that his Majesty's
Government will have forwarded to me explanations respecting it.</p>

<p>The Danes have annoyed the Swedish trade so considerably, that I
understand strong representations will be made on the subject at
Copenhagen, and possibly some retaliation may take place from this
side of the water, if they do not cease their proceedings.</p>

<p>I trust you will have the goodness to let me know if it is your
intention to order the capture of Swedish ships<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> of all kinds which
shall be proceeding from one port of Sweden to another.</p>

<p class="left65">I am, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">A. Foster.</p></div>

<p>Sir James had made known at Gothenburg the article in his instructions
referred to in Mr. Foster's letter, for the express purpose of giving
the Swedes timely notice of the step Government had found it necessary
to take; and being still in hopes that the order would be rescinded,
he had not given directions to his squadron to act upon it, although
it appeared from a communication of the same date from Mr. Foster that
his recall was required by Buonaparte, and that his stay at Stockholm
could not exceed six weeks.</p>

<p>The following is Sir James's reply to Mr. Foster:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Victory, off Ystad, 7th June 1810.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I had the honour to receive both your letters, dated 25th ult., on my
arrival at this place yesterday evening, and I request you will accept
my best thanks for them. I was much surprised, before I sailed from
Hawke Road, to find from Mr. Consul Smith that you had not received
from Government any communication relative to the restrictions upon
the trade of Sweden, having taken it for granted, at the time I
received instructions upon the subject, that intimation of it would
have been made to you by the same conveyance. I trust that you have
before this received explanations respecting it, and that they will
prove as satisfactory to the government of Sweden as the circumstances
will admit.</p>

<p>I have hitherto acted on that part of my instructions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> with the utmost
moderation; but, in conformity to these instructions, it will not be
in my power to desist in future from allowing the cruisers to make
captures of such Swedish vessels as they fall in with, who are not
provided with licences from England. The depredations by the Danish
armed vessels have determined me to give orders to his Majesty's ships
stationed off Kioge Bay not to admit any vessels to enter the Sound,
which I have signified to our Government.</p>

<p>The place you have been pleased to point out for the correspondence in
future is perfectly well adapted, more particularly from its vicinity
to Hano Bay, the rendezvous which I have appointed for the trade, and
where I propose to proceed on receiving despatches which I daily
expect from Gothenburg: I shall therefore hope to have the honour of
hearing from you next by way of Sölvitzborg.</p>

<p>The information I have received from Mr. Fenwick of the lamented death
of the Crown Prince must have thrown this Government under very
considerable embarrassment, and possibly may lead to some change in
the politics of the country.</p>

<p>I request you will favour me with any information you receive relative
to the Russian fleet, as it will in a great degree decide the time
when I may proceed towards the Gulf of Finland. It is with great
satisfaction I have the honour to inform you that the numerous convoys
that have sailed from Gothenburg have all cleared the Belt without
loss, and the two homeward bound convoys are, I hope, by this time far
on their way. The one under protection of the Edgar and Saturn was off
Romsöe last Sunday, and the one which sailed more recently was
yesterday off Dars Head.</p>

<p>I hope the time is yet very distant, but I trust you will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> be pleased
to signify to me the proposed period of your leaving Sweden. I will
give directions for one of the ships under my orders to convey you and
suite to Yarmouth, or any other port you prefer.</p>

<p class="left65">I have, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">James Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>The Author, then lieutenant of the Victory, was despatched to
Sölvitzborg, where he made arrangements with the authorities for the
correspondence between the Admiral and Mr. Foster, and also for a
supply of fresh beef and vegetables for the fleet, which occupied the
Roads of Hano, where the convoys assembled, the merchants having built
store-houses on the island of Hano, previously inhabited by a few
fishermen. The convoys at anchor there consisted of ships under
various neutral flags, which had licences from Government. These
entered St. Petersburg and every port in the Baltic with British
manufactures or colonial produce, returning with timber, hemp, tallow,
&amp;c. the produce of Russia and Prussia. As soon as they had accumulated
to about 500, and the wind came fair, they sailed from Hano under
convoy to the Belt, where a strong force was always kept to protect
them from the attacks of the Danish gun-boats. The tyrannical decrees
of Buonaparte were thus rendered null and void on this part of the
Continent.</p>

<p>The following letter from Mr. Foster to Sir James exhibits in strong
terms the alarm excited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> in Sweden by the communication of the
Admiral, while it points but the excellent policy of his not acting
under the circumstances upon his instructions.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Stockholm, 31st May 1810.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>The situation in which this country has been placed by the publication
of your orders to capture Swedish ships employed in the coasting
trade, has created such an alarm that even private individuals are
afraid to take their passage in the packet boats, between Sweden and
Stralsund, without they have letters from me. Among the rest a M. de
Bon, a merchant of my acquaintance, who is shortly to proceed to
Germany in order to be married to a young lady, the sister of a friend
of mine, has urged me to ask if your excellency means to include the
Stralsund packet-boat in your general orders for capture, or if he can
safely hire a vessel to take him there. Any information you can give
me on the matter will be very agreeable to me. Swedish subjects are of
course free from being made prisoners, as we are not declared at war
with Sweden; but my assertion of the fact is not considered here of
sufficient satisfaction without a particular letter to the commanders
of his Majesty's ships.</p>

<p>I beg you will let me know if you can allow a young Swedish officer to
serve on board any of the ships under your command, as application has
been made to me on the subject.</p>

<p>Admiral Puké is directing all his attention to the defence of
Carlscrona; sailors and soldiers have been sent there from hence, the
latter belonging to the Queen's German regiment, in some transports,
which it is feared may be captured by some of your cruisers. I had
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> honour to write to you twice by the medium of this Government.</p>

<p>Mr. Jacobi will deliver to you a letter which Mr. Millander, a
merchant of this place, has requested I would forward to your
excellency.</p>
<p class="left60">I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">A. Foster.</p></div>

<p>The letter conveyed by Mr. Jacobi respected his making a settlement in
Gothland, which might be of use to the Admiral. This, however, became
unnecessary, in consequence of the occupation of Hano, where supplies
were plentifully obtained. Hano was also more convenient for convoys,
and for communicating with England, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Several letters passed between the Admiral and Mr. Foster on the same
subject; at length Rear-admiral Krusenstjerna was deputed to
communicate verbally what could not be committed to paper. This
officer pointed out the harbour of Matwick, only a few leagues to the
northward of Hano, as the situation most suitable for the collection
of convoys under the circumstances. This, being surveyed, was found to
be safe and capacious. It was formed by a number of small islands,
while it was impossible for any power, unless with a superior naval
force, to molest the ships in the harbour.</p>

<p>On the 6th of June directions to rescind the orders to capture Swedish
ships were given. These reached Sir James in a week, after which
things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> went on smoothly and agreeably, no captures of any consequence
having been made during the time the order was in force. Buonaparte,
finding that his views of restricting British commerce were
frustrated, insisted that the British minister should quit Stockholm;
and Mr. Foster, having only forty hours' notice, arrived at Gothenburg
on the 14th June. Here he wrote the following letters to Sir James,
which will show the state of affairs, and the propriety of the steps
the Admiral had hitherto taken.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Gothenburg, 14th June 1810.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I should have written from Stockholm to inform you of my being obliged
to quit that capital; but the Swedish minister's letters to me,
conveying the wish of the Government that I should depart, gave me but
forty hours to prepare myself, and I had scarcely time for any other
occupation than that of getting ready during so short a period. I left
Stockholm on the morning of the 8th inst. and arrived at Gothenburg
this evening. I am anxiously waiting to receive orders from home, in
order to take my departure.</p>

<p>The Swedish Government has now notified in London its intention to
shut the ports of Sweden to his Majesty's packet-boats; therefore, I
expect from day to day that an order will arrive for their exclusion.
Captain Honeyman of his Majesty's ship Ardent has been kind enough to
offer me a passage on board the Chanticleer, if she can be detained a
few days, and I shall very willingly and thankfully accept of the
offer.</p>

<p>Baron d'Engeström considered my departure, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> cessation of the
correspondence between England and Sweden, as a necessary consequence
of the treaties of peace lately concluded by this country, and
therefore as not likely to produce any change in the present relations
with Great Britain; indeed they have both long been announced as being
to take place. The communication, therefore, will still be winked at,
as I have reason to believe, by the Swedish Government, but it must be
done privately.</p>

<p class="left65">I have, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">Augt. Foster.</p></div>

<p>The next letter was dated Gothenburg, 16th June; and after reiterating
the above and acknowledging a despatch from Sir James, he adds,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>I am sincerely rejoiced at the modifications which have been made of
your original instructions how to act towards the Swedes, and I have
great satisfaction in telling you that, even previously to my leaving
Stockholm, your conversation with Mr. Brinkman had been reported to
the Swedish minister, and the language you had held, and your moderate
conduct subsequently, in regard to their trade, had made upon his mind
the most favourable impressions. Both he and the rest of the cabinet
of Stockholm seemed convinced that you had executed your orders with
as much mildness and consideration for this country as could possibly
be expected.</p></div>

<p>The following is Sir James's reply to these letters:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Victory, Hano Bay, 20th June 1810.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have received the honour of your letters dated the 14th and 16th
inst., informing me of your sudden departure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> from Stockholm, of which
I had been previously apprised by Admiral Krusenstjerna. However
deeply I must regret being deprived at this crisis of your important
communications, I hope your arrival in England will be the means of
furnishing Government with information relative to the state of
Sweden, of which they could not otherwise have been in possession.</p>

<p>The instructions I have received, containing the modifications upon
the coasting trade of this country, have given me infinite
satisfaction; and I am happy to find, from what you have been pleased
to mention on the subject, that the moderation with which I have acted
has been highly approved of by the Swedish Government.</p>

<p>Having written my last courier to Captain Honeyman, senior officer in
Hawke Road, directing him to appropriate one of the ships upon the
station to convey you and your suite to Yarmouth, or any other port
you desired, I trust he will be able to accommodate you to your
satisfaction.</p>

<p>With my best wishes for your speedy and safe passage.</p>

<p>The following farewell letter, written by Mr. Foster to Sir James on
leaving Sweden, gives a more decided opinion on the state of Sweden
than has hitherto been offered. It concludes the correspondence.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>The politics of Sweden have necessarily undergone a great change. The
death of the Crown Prince has completed the disasters of the nation,
and such is its present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> state of weakness and discouragement, that I
cannot consider the Swedes as having any longer a shadow of
independence. Their exposed local situation, will prevent their taking
any offensive measures of hostility against us; the futility of any
effort of the sort prevents its being exacted from them by Buonaparte;
but I have recommended strongly to the merchants here, who have
British property, to place it under neutral cover, and by no means to
expose themselves in any way through a want of proper precaution. I
have had the satisfaction to find they have attended to my advice.</p>

<p>Give me leave, sir, to repeat my best thanks for the communications
you continued to honour me with during my residence in Sweden, and to
assure you that I am, with great regard and esteem,</p>

<p class="left65">Sir, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right">A. Foster.</p>

<p>To his Excellency Admiral Sir James Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>Some false reports having been circulated that the cruisers under the
orders of Sir James had captured several Swedish ships bound to
England and other ports, from which the English flag was not excluded,
the Right Hon. Charles Yorke, then first Lord of the Admiralty, wrote
a private letter to Sir James accompanying the modification of the
order already alluded to, and directing that any captures made under
its operation might be restored. To which communication Sir James made
the following reply:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Victory, 20th June 1810.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have this morning received the honour of your letter on the subject
of the trade of Sweden, in which you are pleased to observe that the
Marquess of Wellesley had communicated to you that he had received
information that some of the ships under my orders have detained and
captured some ships from a Swedish port destined to the port of
London, to which I beg leave to state that the information must have
been incorrect, the detention or capture of any vessel of that
description being contrary to the orders I have given to the cruisers
on this station, and no report having been made to me of any having
been detained. I beg further to observe, that to every application
made to me by any of the merchants, I gave my decided opinion that
Swedish ships trading to England, or to those countries where Swedish
produce was admitted, were not liable to detention, and that they
would not be molested by the cruisers under my orders. Knowing the
extreme distress that Sweden must suffer from the interruption of her
coasting trade, I acted upon the instructions I received with the
utmost possible moderation, consistent with the tenor of those
instructions. They were not acted upon until I had an opportunity of
communicating with the Consul at Gothenburg, and some of the principal
merchants, who appeared perfectly satisfied with the indulgence I
allowed to the trade of Sweden under the existing circumstances, and
the same has been signified to me by the Swedish Government, who have
expressed themselves satisfied with the mildness and consideration
with which I have uniformly acted to this country. I shall therefore
feel most sensibly, if any unfavourable cases have been made by
misstatements upon any part of my conduct since I came upon this
station.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> There being no immediate appearance of the Russian fleet
putting to sea, I propose to remain here some time longer, for the
greater facility of communicating with England, as well as for
accelerating the trade from this rendezvous.</p>

<p class="left50">I have the honour to be, with great regard, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">James Saumarez.</p>

<p>To the Right Hon. C. Yorke.</p></div>

<p>Everything being now adjusted to the satisfaction of both Governments,
the trade was carried on by means of licences to the ports in Russia
and Prussia, while the Swedish coasters and packets met with no
interruption. The Swedes began to look for a successor to the throne
to fill the place of the late lamented Crown Prince. The candidates
were the King of Denmark, the Prince of Oldenburg, and the French
General Bernadotte, the Prince of Ponte Corvo. The last was proposed
by Count Mörner, to whom he had shown much kindness when a prisoner.
In order to secure his election he sent over a large sum of money by
means of the Swedish Stralsund packets, which performed their voyage
unmolested; and the first intimation of this event was obtained by the
author about the 15th of August, when he met the waggons loaded with
specie on their route from Ystad to Stockholm. Soon after which he was
informed that Admiral Krusenstjerna was to arrive at Carlsham on the
20th, and he accordingly met him with Sir James's assurance,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> that he
would be received on board the Victory and permitted to depart after
having made his communication to the Admiral.</p>

<p>This will be best explained by Sir James's public despatches to the
first Lord of the Admiralty, of which the following is a copy.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Victory, Hano Bay, 21st Aug. 1810.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>Admiral Krusenstjerna has done me the honour this morning to come on
board the Victory, with a verbal communication which he has been
charged to make to me from the King of Sweden relative to the election
of an heir apparent to the throne. After expressing to me the regard
and confidence of his Swedish Majesty for my services to Sweden,
Admiral Krusenstjerna signified to me that he was desired by his
Swedish Majesty to communicate to me his Swedish Majesty's intentions
to maintain the harmony and good understanding that subsist between
the respective nations, in which the interest of Sweden is so
particularly concerned. In order to the maintenance of that harmony,
as well as for the existence of Sweden, it was indispensable that the
Government should be headed by a person who was independent, and not
liable to submit to the will of others. He was directed to inform me
that of the four persons who have been proposed to be successor to the
throne of Sweden, the Prince of Augustenburg had declined the
acceptance of that distinction, in favour of his Majesty the King of
Denmark, but who, from political circumstances, was <i>not</i> considered
eligible. The Prince of Oldenburg had also been mentioned, but
insuperable objections also arose to prevent the choice fixing upon
his Serene Highness. The Prince of Ponte Corvo, through the medium of
the Swedish minister at Paris, had offered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> himself a candidate for
the high situation, and was the person recommended by the King of
Sweden to the Diet now assembled at Orebro, to be successor to the
late Crown Prince.</p>

<p>Admiral Krusenstjerna was also instructed to signify to me that the
Prince of Ponte Corvo, in offering himself for this distinction, had
professed his firm intentions, as far as depended on him, to maintain
the relative situations between England and Sweden, and that his
proposing himself was without the participation of Buonaparte. He
further mentioned that he was of all others the person who would have
the firmness to oppose the intentions of Buonaparte, or his agents and
ministers, in the intercourse with other countries.</p>

<p>The Admiral was further directed to signify to me that the King of
Sweden earnestly hoped that this communication would be acceptable to
the King, my august sovereign, and that it would be considered as an
additional proof of his earnest wish to preserve the harmony and
friendship that have so long subsisted between the two nations.</p>

<p>I requested that Admiral Krusenstjerna would put down in writing the
substance of the communication he had to make to me, which he
declined, being contrary to the instructions he had received. I have,
however, stated the particulars of the whole communication, as nearly
as I possibly can from memory.</p>

<p class="left60">I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">James Saumarez.</p>

<p>To the Right Hon. C. Yorke,<br />
<span class="i2">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</span></p></div>

<p>The Swedish Government, aware that objections would probably be made
by the English ministers to the election of a French general in the
service<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> of Buonaparte, as successor to the throne of Sweden, had so
managed that the above communication should not be made until too late
for any remonstrance. The following message from the King to the Diet
had been delivered, and their decision was expected before Admiral
Krusenstjerna could return to Orebro.</p>

<p>"His Royal Majesty Charles XIII, King of Sweden, &amp;c. Our most gracious
proposition and message to the Diet now assembled respecting the
election of a successor to the Crown of Sweden," &amp;c.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Orebro, 10th August 1810.</p>

<p>At this crisis the States of Sweden having met, and since the last
Diet more than three months having elapsed, every good Swede must have
reflected on his situation. After great misfortunes and innumerable
troubles, the kingdom appeared to be a little calm. Three treaties of
peace which have taken place have unfortunately diminished the
territory of Sweden. A noble Prince at the side of the throne, by his
virtue, talents, and abilities, promised new regulations and orders,
which the King and the people had already forwarded. His manner of
appointing the army gives an excellent proof of the good choice made
by our native country; but a great national misfortune occurred, by
which our hopes were destroyed.</p>

<p>His Royal Majesty dwelt on that hope, and overwhelmed with grief, his
sorrowful heart beheld Sweden's last misfortune. The Crown Prince,
Carl August, is no more, and a cloud has overcast the joyful and
bright days of our native country. With a heart rent by sorrow and
affliction, his Royal Majesty has assembled the Diet, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> this
occasion to repair the loss. His Royal Majesty sees on our side
endless disputes and disturbances throughout the realm. His Royal
Majesty's years are far advanced, and he wishes to employ his last
days for his people's repose. He will be happy when he has seen his
people unanimous, and their swords sheathed, and the laws and
constitution kept sacred; then he will end his days happily, and at
the present time will give them a proof of his love for his native
country by proposing a successor to the throne, whose talents,
virtues, and abilities are universally admitted.</p>

<p>With the utmost tenderness for the welfare of his subjects, he now
recommends a prompt decision on the choice of an heir to the Crown,
and offers to the voice of his people, as his choice, the Prince of
Ponte Corvo, whose name is brightened by his glorious deeds and
laurels of honour, and whose unparalleled services deservedly obtained
them. His renowned knowledge as a statesman has astonished every body;
his mildness and compassion, even to an enemy, have gained him the
respect and affection of all ranks. Separated from the misfortunes
which have hitherto attended Swedish warriors, we must judge of the
Prince with the most tender sensations, and with them he will use the
sword. Indeed, all the circumstances have convinced his Royal Majesty,
and having maturely considered the nation's public and secret affairs,
his Royal Majesty recommends him to be elected as his heir.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p></div>

<p>According to this recommendation the Prince of Ponte Corvo was elected
on the 21st of August, the very day on which the communication was
made by Admiral Krusenstjerna, but, as it was reported, not without
opposition by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> friends of the son of the deposed King, Gustavus
the IVth, Adolphus, and it was even said that had the numbers on each
side been counted the majority would have been in his favour.</p>

<p>After Sir James had sent off the despatch of the 21st, he had another
conference with the Swedish Admiral, who then returned with Sir
James's assurance that the conference should be faithfully reported.
On the 22nd he sent off another courier with a despatch, of which the
following is an extract:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Victory, Hano Bay, 22nd August 1810.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>Having heard the various motives assigned by Admiral Krusenstjerna for
the election of the Prince of Ponte Corvo to be the successor to the
Crown of Sweden, I observed to him that I extremely regretted that
this communication had not been made in time to enable me to obtain
the sentiments of my Government, previous to the election taking
place. That it was probable the election of a general officer in the
service of the most inveterate enemy that England had to oppose would
be highly obnoxious to his Majesty's Government, and I earnestly urged
him to entreat the King of Sweden to delay the election until I could
receive a return to the letters I would immediately send to England by
an express. I repeatedly pressed this point to Admiral Krusenstjerna,
who intimated that the election would be decided before he could
return to Orebro, as it was understood to take place during the
present week.</p>

<p>On his observing that Prince Ponte Corvo was the only one of the four
candidates that could be accepted by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> Sweden, and requesting me who,
in my opinion, ought to be elected, I immediately replied that I
considered the son of the deposed monarch, Gustavus Adolphus, was the
person who naturally presented himself as the most proper successor to
the throne of Sweden, and that the age and state of health of the
reigning monarch led to the expectation that he would live until the
Prince became of age. He stated that the King at this time required
the aid and assistance of a military character, possessed of strength
of mind and energy to govern the country, and who also would have the
spirit to maintain her in her foreign relations, and in resisting the
power of Russia and France, which he said Bernadotte had faithfully
promised to do.</p>

<p>Admiral Krusenstjerna expressed repeatedly his confidence in my
reporting the communication in the most favourable terms to his
Majesty's ministers, adding, that on this would greatly depend the
light in which it would be considered. I uniformly replied, that was
not in my power, but that his Swedish Majesty might be assured of my
transmitting a faithful report of what he had done me the honour to
communicate.</p></div>

<p>In a Postscript to this letter, which was addressed to the Right Hon.
Charles Yorke, he says,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
<p>Lieutenant Ross of the Victory, who went on shore with the Swedish
Admiral, was requested to inform me, that he had omitted to mention,
that the Prince of Ponte Corvo had promised to invest all the property
he possessed, said to amount to eight millions sterling, in Sweden, as
a pledge of his intentions to maintain the country in her foreign
relations.</p></div>

<p>The next packet from England brought the accounts of Sir James's
promotion to the rank of Vice-admiral of the Red, and also the
confirmation of several appointments made by the Admiral on the station.
We may now mention the answer given by Mr. Yorke to the two last
despatches, although dated on the 18th of September. After acknowledging
the receipt of them, communicating the election of Bernadotte as
successor to the Crown of Sweden, he says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>These interesting papers, which confirmed accounts that had been
previously received of this extraordinary transaction, have been
communicated to the King's ministers. I have at present only to
express to you my sense of the prudent and proper manner in which you
appear to have conducted yourself on this occasion in your
conversation with the Swedish Admiral, and to acquaint you that the
earnest desire entertained by his Majesty's Government of preserving
the relations of peace and amity with Sweden, as long as possible,
remains unalterable.</p>

<p>About this time two untoward events took place, which threatened a
commencement of hostilities between the two nations. The one was the
attack of the Hero's boats on a Danish privateer lying in the Swedish
harbour of Marstrand, in which a midshipman was killed, and others
wounded; and the second was the conduct of Captain Acklom, of the
Ranger, in spiking the guns of the Swedish armed schooner Celeritas.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
On these, however, concessions were made on both sides; Captain
Newman, of the Hero, was wrong in attacking an enemy's vessel under
the guns of a Swedish fortress without apprising the Governor of his
intention, while the Governor was no less so in giving protection to
an enemy's vessel which came there with the avowed intention of
attacking the Hero's convoy. Capt. Acklom, though not justified in his
proceeding, did it under the impression that she was affording
protection to an illicit trade, and to French vessels fitting in
neutral ports; while on the other hand it was notorious that such
trade was carried on.</p></div>

<p>To return to the correspondence. The following letter was received
from the Swedish Admiral, dated</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Orebro, 29th August 1810.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honour to inform your excellency of my arrival at this town
on the 24th, and that on the following day I was introduced to his
Majesty, who graciously permitted me to relate the contents of the
conference with your excellency, which I had the honour to hold on the
21st. His Majesty, of whose particular regard I have been intrusted
verbally to assure your excellency, expressed to me even on this
occasion his most sincere wishes and his firm resolution to maintain,
as much as will depend on him, the moderate system and good harmony
which still subsist between our respective nations.</p>

<p>The election of a successor to the Swedish throne was executed on the
21st, three days before my return.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> I do myself the honour to enclose
for your excellency's information a true copy of the act of election.
The obligation therein prescribed the successor to turn over to the
religion of this country, and to resign all his foreign titles and
employments, will, I hope, serve as a proof to convince your
excellency that no French interest can have directed or imposed upon
the free choice of the representatives of the nation. The Prince of
Ponte Corvo is really; in my private opinion, the only man who, at the
head of the Swedish Government, will be capable to oppose the despotic
influence of Buonaparte and his agents, to maintain the independence,
and promote the true interest of the Swedish nation.</p>

<p class="left65">I have, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c</p>
<p class="right smcap">M.P. Krusenstjerna.</p></div>

<p>The rest of the correspondence related to the adjustment of the
differences before mentioned. Sir James was satisfied with the
declaration on the part of the Swedish Government that no protection
should be afforded to Danish and French armed vessels, while on the
other hand the Swedes were satisfied with Sir James's disapproval of
the conduct of Captains Newman and Acklom, requesting that no further
notice might be taken of these officers. In like manner were adjusted
the differences occasioned by the legal capture of a vessel loaded
with drugs and medicines, and another with oil and tallow from St.
Petersburg; the former had been sent to England, but was released, the
latter was given up on security being pledged for her cargo, which was
eventually repurchased<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> by the owners: on all these occasions the
author was employed confidentially.</p>

<p>Sir James now rendered a great service by prevailing on Government to
allow the trade of Sweden and Swedish Pomerania to remain unmolested,
on condition that French armed vessels should not be fitted out at
Stralsund and other ports on that coast; he also granted licences for
ships to import medicines and grain into Sweden, without which the
country must have been reduced to great misery.</p>

<p>The Russian fleet, which consisted of about eight sail of the line,
made no disposition of moving from Cronstadt; it was therefore
unnecessary for the fleet to proceed to the Gulf of Finland, and Sir
James directed the whole of his attention to the protection of the
commerce, in which he completely succeeded by the judicious
arrangements and the disposition of the naval force under his command.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the season, and in compliance with the wishes of
the Admiralty, he despatched three sail of the line to England, and
left Hano Bay in the Victory on the 10th of October, only two days
previously to the return of Admiral Krusenstjerna, a circumstance much
regretted by both.</p>

<p>On arriving in the Belt, with a convoy of no less than a thousand sail
homeward bound, it was intimated that the French Prince of Ponte
Corvo, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> newly elected successor to the throne, was at Nyborg, and
permission to cross the Belt was demanded and obtained from the
Admiral for his yacht to pass unmolested, which he did on the 14th of
October at the time this immense fleet was at anchor off Spröe. A
scene so novel to a French general, and so interesting to his Royal
Highness under the present circumstances, could not but make a deep
impression, while it conveyed some idea of the wealth and power of the
British nation; and he has subsequently told the author that it was
the most beautiful and wonderful sight he had ever beheld, being one
of which he had never formed an idea. The day was very fine; the fleet
was anchored in a close compact body, with the Victory in the centre,
bearing the Admiral's red flag at the fore, surrounded by six ships of
the line, and six frigates and sloops disposed for the complete
protection of the convoy.</p>

<p>The yacht, with a Swedish flag containing the Crown Prince, passing
within a mile of the Victory, was distinctly seen, and escorted by
some barges from the men-of-war until past the whole of the ships; the
convoy soon after weighed anchor, when the Royal stranger had the
pleasure of seeing them all under sail and proceeding to their
destination, regardless of the enemies who occupied the adjacent
shores.</p>

<p>The Victory arrived at Gothenburg on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> 18th October, and thence
despatched the large convoy to England. On Sir James's arrival he
received despatches informing him of the probability of the
Franco-Dutch fleet at the Scheldt attempting, if they escaped the
north sea fleet under Admiral Pellew, to force their way into the
Sound; at the same time it was not yet certain that the Russian ships
at Archangel would not try to effect a passage into the Baltic. Sir
James therefore found it necessary to concentrate his force in Hawke
Roads, and felt confident that he could still protect the trade, if
not prevent the superior fleet from entering the Sound, to Copenhagen.</p>

<p>An event now took place which occasioned considerable embarrassment,
namely the escape of the deposed King of Sweden, Gustavus IV,
(Adolphus) who got on board the Tartarus, from Riga, and, after
calling at Matvick, came through the Belt and arrived at Gothenburg
before Sir James could have an answer from Government as to his
permission to go to England, which was his avowed intention. Sir
James, after paying his respects to him, complied with his urgent
request to be sent in the Tartarus to England, and Sir James, without
waiting longer, ordered Captain Mainwaring to take his Majesty to
Yarmouth. The Swedes were much pleased at this, as they dreaded the
consequences of his remaining long on board an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> English ship of war at
Gothenburg. His arrival and residence in England need not be further
referred to: the anxiety of the Swedes on his account was soon
relieved by the intelligence that it was not the intention of
Government to interfere in his behalf, or with the internal Government
of Sweden.</p>

<p>The new Crown Prince arrived safely at Stockholm, and contrary to the
expectation of every officer on board the fleet, excepting Sir James,
gave manifest proofs of his independence of French influence, and of
his intentions to cultivate the friendship of Great Britain, although
he could not be pleased that the Swedish Government Stock, into which
he had placed so large a sum when at a high rate, fell again to par,
as it was before. It would appear, however, that Buonaparte, who had
given his sanction to the advancement of Bernadotte with great
reluctance, was displeased at the beginning with his conduct, and he
consequently gave an order for the confiscation of all British
property in the Swedish harbours. Notwithstanding the earliest
information of this decree was given by the Swedes, a considerable
number of shipping and merchandise came under it, and Sir James having
withdrawn his force from within the Baltic, owing to the lateness of
the season, it was no longer in his power to rescue it in that
quarter; but he had still a sufficient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> force in Hawke Roads, and
might, had he been compelled to retaliate, have totally destroyed the
city of Gothenburg.</p>

<p>On this occasion the author was sent to communicate with Count Rosen,
the worthy governor of that city, whose word and honour could be fully
depended on, and he received his solemn assurances that it was not the
intention of the Swedish Government to act upon the declaration which
it had been forced to make, contrary to the wishes of the Swedish
nation, and particularly offensive to the Crown Prince. He had
represented to Government the incalculable injury which the British
Admiral, with the force still at Hawke Roads, might do to the city and
the commerce, and recommended that every facility should be given to
the English merchants to cover and remove their property.</p>

<p>The following are the declarations and explanation of them given by
Count Rosen.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>1st. The Swedish Government declares war, it is true, against Great
Britain; but it is not said that <i>any measures</i> of active hostility
are to be had recourse to.</p>

<p>2nd. Should it be found that there are any British merchant ships in
Swedish ports they are to be <i>detained</i> (no mention is made of
confiscation or even sequestration). It will be recollected that the
declaration of the 24th April prohibited the entry of British vessels,
and we believe there are none in Swedish ports.</p>

<p>3rd. It is declared that there is a sufficient quantity of colonial
produce now in Sweden for the internal consumption of the country; no
more shall be allowed to be imported,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> nor shall any be exported from
Sweden <i>to the Continent</i>; but nothing is said of the trade with the
islands or with America, nor is it stated that a fresh supply shall
not be imported when the stock at present on hand is consumed, and we
apprehend that it will be difficult to fix the precise quantity
necessary for the home consumption, without leaving any surplus for
exportation. It is understood that the communication with England will
be continued, but it is necessary it should be done with caution, and
the Government recommends it should be weekly, and that the mails and
passengers should be landed at a place to be pointed out.</p></div>

<p>Count Rosen assured the Admiral, both through the author, Consul
Smith, and others, that he was instructed by the Swedish Government to
inform Sir James Saumarez that it was not their intention to follow up
the declaration by any act of hostility.</p>

<p>Having received these assurances, Sir James, notwithstanding that the
officers with whom he was surrounded were of a different opinion,
conceived he could rely on the sincerity of the Swedes, and determined
that, at all events, he would not commit the first hostile act. With
his usual moderation he therefore remained quiet at anchor until he
had given time to the merchants to do all that could be done, and then
prepared to leave Sweden without firing a shot against her.</p>

<p>In the mean time Sir James received the approbation of Government for
his judicious, firm, and moderate conduct, which was fully
acknowledged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> on all sides to have been hitherto the means of
preserving peace and good will between Sweden and England. Mr. Yorke
says in his last letter,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>I embrace this opportunity of expressing the high approbation of the
Board, as well of the steps you have taken for receiving and sending
to England the King of Sweden (Count Gottorp) as of those for
collecting such a force in Hawke Roads for the purpose of checking the
enemy.</p></div>

<p>Admiral Krusenstjerna concludes his farewell letter to Sir James in
the following words:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>I am perfectly persuaded that my Royal sovereign will enjoy the
greatest satisfaction in accepting the assurances your excellency has
been pleased to communicate, of his Britannic Majesty's intentions to
preserve the harmony and good understanding that exist between both
nations, intentions which, for the benefit and prosperity of both
countries, it has been an object of his Swedish Majesty's earnest
wishes and most studious endeavours to inspire in the British
Government. The zealous support which your excellency has been pleased
to give for promoting this great interest, entitles your excellency to
the <span class="smcap">gratitude</span> of the Swedish nation and the most distinguished regard
from its sovereign. It is with sentiments of the most perfect esteem
and consideration that I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="right">P.K.</p></div>

<p>Sir James had now received accounts from England that the enemy's
fleet in Holland had moved up the Scheldt for the winter, and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
the Russians had abandoned their project of bringing their ships from
Archangel. Peace had been made between Russia and the Porte, and their
troops were withdrawing towards Poland. The Victory sailed from
Gothenburg on the 28th of November, and on the 3rd December arrived
safely in the Downs, whence Sir James proceeded to London to receive
the thanks of his Majesty's ministers and the nation for his zealous,
able, judicious, and temperate conduct, and for the important services
he had rendered to his country during this eventful period.</p>

<p class="p2"></p>

<p>The beginning of the year 1811 was remarkable, as being the period at
which the tyrant of France had arrived at the summit of his career. He
had seized upon Hamburg and every other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> place on the Continent,
whence a seaman could be procured, and had declared that with one
hundred and fifty sail of the line he would humble the navy of England
and conquer a "Maritime Peace." The disasters of 1810, that ended with
the loss of his Majesty's ship Minotaur, and a large convoy on the
Haake Sands, and the illness of his Majesty George the Third, which
terminated only with the life of that excellent Monarch, threw a damp
on the spirits of the nation, and caused a suspension of all Royal
functions until the appointment of the Regency, on which his Royal
Highness the Prince of Wales took the reins of government at one of
the most eventful periods that ever occurred in the history of the
empire.</p>

<p>Sir James, immediately after his communications with the Admiralty and
the Ministers, applied for and obtained leave of absence. His ship,
the Victory, with seven sail of the line under Sir Joseph Yorke, was
employed in transporting troops to Lisbon, which was surrounded by
Massena's army; but she returned in time to receive Sir James's flag,
which was hoisted on the 2nd of April.</p>

<p>The island of Anholt, which had been garrisoned by seamen and marines
under the command of Captain James W. Maurice, of the Royal Navy, was
attacked on the 23rd of March by a body of Danish troops, amounting to
1600 men; but they were so well received by the Governor and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
brave crew (for the island was on the establishment of a vessel of
war) that they were forced to capitulate, with the loss of their
leader Major Melstedt, two officers, and 500 of their people in
killed, wounded, and prisoners; while Capt. Baker, of the Tartar, and
Captain J.P. Stewart, of the Sheldrake, chased and took several of
their gun-boats employed on that expedition.</p>

<p>Sir James had finished his three years in the Baltic, the time
generally prescribed for an Admiral commanding-in-chief to remain on
one station, and it was now his turn to have a command in the
Mediterranean, which was considered more lucrative; but his conduct
during his command in the Baltic had so completely gained the
confidence and good-will of the Swedes, and it had now become of such
importance to keep them, with such a general as Bernadotte at their
head, on good terms, that he was requested to continue on that most
important command, as the only chance of accomplishing the desirable
object of a Northern coalition. Nothing could be more delicate or more
difficult than the situation in which Sir James was now placed, for
while it required firmness to uphold the dignity of the empire which
he represented, as the only diplomatic functionary as well as
commander-in-chief in the North, tact, wisdom, and forbearance were
equally indispensable. These qualities Sir James possessed in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
superlative degree, and the Author, who from his knowledge of the
Swedish language was employed confidentially on all the communications
which subsequently took place, can testify that it is to the wise
policy of the Admiral that the nation owes the success of these
negociations. It is the opinion of Swedish and Russian diplomatists
that had Sir James not been employed, the Northern Coalition, which
was so fatal to the ambitious views of Buonaparte, never would have
taken place; and for such a service no reward which it was in the
power of Government to bestow on him would have been too great. There
can be no doubt, had the lamented Perceval not met with an untimely
end by the hand of an assassin, that he would at the close of 1812
have been rewarded by the Peerage which was so long unaccountably
withheld.</p>

<p>Sir James was still in London when he received the statement of the
discomfiture of the Danish attack on Anholt, a particular account of
which may be seen in James's Naval History.</p>

<p>The following letters on this gallant affair, which have not yet been
published, will be perused with interest.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">London, 10th April 1811.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Sir,</p>

<p>I most heartily congratulate you on the brilliant success of the brave
garrison under your command in having repulsed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> an attack of the
enemy's select troops, consisting of as many thousands as the whole
band opposed to them amounted to hundreds, and by the gallantry and
intrepid conduct of your valiant heroes, succeeded in taking a greater
number of prisoners than your whole collected force. Mr. Yorke having
signified to me that he should write to you, I can only assure you
that this gallant affair is the theme of every one's praise, and has
excited the admiration of all, and I have no doubt but your services
upon this occasion will be duly appreciated by the Admiralty. I have
great pleasure in adding that Lieutenant Baker is made a commander,
and that Captain Torrens and Lieut. Fisher are recommended to his
Royal Highness the Prince Regent for Brevet rank.</p>

<p class="left65">I have, &amp;c. with high regard,</p>
<p class="right smcap">James Saumarez.</p>

<p>Captain Maurice, Governor of Anholt.</p></div>

<p>In Captain Maurice's letter the Danish force was estimated at 4,000
men, but it does not appear that their numbers exceeded 3,000,
including the crews of the gun-vessels. Sixteen hundred men only were
landed, and the defence which these made was highly creditable to
them. It has therefore been justly said, that "if the British gained
honour by their victory, the Danes lost none by their defeat." The
unexpected arrival of the Tartar frigate and Sheldrake sloop turned
the scale; the Danish gun-boats being unable to cope with that naval
force, abandoned the brave troops they had landed as soon as the
frigate and sloop were discovered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> Before the fleet left England, Sir
James received the following letter from his Serene Highness the Duke
of Brunswick:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Great George Street, London, 6th April 1811.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I take the liberty to recommend to your kindness Major Nordenfeldt,
who is gone to Germany on private affairs of my family. I imagine that
the difficulties he has met with in returning to England are the cause
of his having been more than six months absent. If circumstances
should allow him to pass from Colberg to this country, I request your
interference on his behalf, and that you would have the goodness to
communicate to him the inclosed order of Government<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> for landing
either at Portsmouth or Yarmouth.</p>

<p class="left65">I am, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">William, Duke of Brunswick.</p>
<p>To Vice-admiral Sir James Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>To this letter Sir James wrote the following answer:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">St. James's Place, London, 6th April 1811.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have received the honour of your Serene Highness's letter respecting
Major Nordenfeldts, and inclosing one from Mr. Harrison of the
Treasury, which I shall have great pleasure in delivering to Major
Nordenfeldts, should I meet with him on his way from Colberg, and I
shall also use my endeavours to facilitate his means of returning to
England.</p>

<p class="left50">I have the honour to be,<br />
<span class="i1">With the highest respect, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p class="right smcap">James Saumarez.</p>
<p>To his Serene Highness the Duke of Brunswick.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
The deposed King of Sweden, after having spent the winter in England,
was embarked on board the Horatio to return to the Continent, but
choosing to remain longer than necessary on board that ship, Sir James
wrote instructions how to act respecting him; but he had fortunately
disembarked before Sir James's arrival in the Baltic. He sailed from
the Downs on the 28th of April and arrived at Gothenburg on the 2nd of
May 1811, where he was received joyfully by the Swedes, although they
could not publicly give vent to their feelings.</p>

<p>On Sir James's arrival he wrote the following letter to the Admiralty:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Victory, in Wingo Sound, 3rd May 1811.</p>

<p>I have the honour to acquaint you with my arrival here yesterday
morning, after a short passage of only four days from the Downs.
Admiral Reynolds arrived here with the detachment from Hosley Bay ten
days before, and Admiral Dixon yesterday evening. The weather proving
unfavourable, I have received no communication from Gothenburg, except
by a letter from Mr. Consul Smith, informing me that, on his having
signified my arrival to the Governor, he immediately despatched a
courier to Stockholm, agreeably to orders he had received from thence,
and that when the courier reached Stockholm, it would determine the
commander-in-chief Count Essen's journey to Gothenburg, which had been
postponed until the account of my arrival was received.</p>

<p>The Consul adds, that everything was very tranquil hitherto, and that
I should see him soon on board the Victory.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> I received letters from
Mr. Fenwick informing me that the Danes were fitting out more than
double the number of privateers and armed vessels than they did last
year, intending, if possible, to obstruct the passage of the convoys
through the Belt. This is a service that I fear will be attended with
much hazard and difficulty, if the trade is carried on to any
considerable extent.</p>

<p>The island of Anholt is threatened with a second attack, and will
require stationary force for its protection.</p>

<p class="left65">I am, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">James Saumarez.</p>

<p>To the Right Hon. C. Yorke,<br />
<span class="i2">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</span></p></div>

<p>On the 4th of May Sir James received the alarming intelligence that
the cargoes of both goods and colonial produce at Carlshamn, were
ordered by the Governor of Carlscrona to be discharged and conveyed up
the country. Admiral Puké had also ordered three of the largest
merchant ships to be fitted as block ships for the additional defence
of Carlshamn, which was considered as a bad omen.</p>

<p>No one, excepting Sir James, doubted that this was an act of
hostility, and that a retaliation on our part would speedily take
place. The Admiral, however, judged that it was only to keep quiet the
French agents. He accordingly forbore to proceed to hostilities, and
wrote the following letter to Mr. Yorke:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Victory, Wingo Sound, 11th May 1811.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I received two days ago the enclosed from Mr. Fenwick, informing me of
the unloading of the cargoes on board<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> the neutral vessels at
Carlshamn, and that the British goods and colonial produce had been
conveyed up the country. Although Mr. Fenwick appears under very
considerable alarm at the circumstance, I do not believe it to have
been with any hostile views against our commerce, although it
certainly requires explanation, and I have written to Mr. Smith upon
the subject.</p>

<p>I expected to have received some communication from Stockholm, in
consequence of the courier which was despatched upon my arrival; but
nothing has as yet reached me. This is rather a dubious crisis, and I
trust soon to be better informed of the sentiments of the Swedish
Government towards us; at the same time, I have no reason to believe
they are more hostile than last year.</p>

<p class="left50">I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</p>

<p>To the Right Hon. C. Yorke, <br />
<span class="i2">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</span></p></div>

<p>At the same time Sir James wrote the following letter to Rear-admiral
Reynolds, who had been ordered to Hano, the place of rendezvous, which
is only six leagues from Carlshamn.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Victory, in Wingo Sound, 11th May 1811.</p>

<p class="right smcap">My Dear Reynolds,</p>

<p>This will be delivered to you by Mr. Wilkinson, the gentleman I
mentioned to you on leaving the Victory: he proposes establishing
himself upon Hano Island for the furtherance of commercial
arrangements, and as he is well known as a person of respectability, I
beg leave to introduce him to your friendly offices.</p>

<p>I have not been able as yet to obtain any explanation of the
extraordinary circumstance that has taken place at Carlshamn, and I am
as yet uninformed whether it has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> been a business of the merchants
only, or by direction of the Government. As soon as I can receive any
information, I shall write to you by a courier; in the mean time, we
cannot act with too great moderation in the present state of affairs.</p>

<p class="left50">Believe me,<br />
<span class="i1">With the highest regard, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</span></p>
<p class="right smcap">James Saumarez.</p>

<p>To Rear-admiral Reynolds,<br />
<span class="i2">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</span></p></div>

<p>Meanwhile Sir James, instead of making any hostile demonstration, most
readily complied with the request of Count Rosen, the Governor of
Gothenburg, to grant him a licence for a vessel to sail to Lubeck for
medicine and drugs for the use of Sweden, and enclosed him passports
for Baron Stedinck for the purpose of allowing two vessels to proceed
to St. Petersburg, to convey his excellency from thence to Stockholm.
He concludes his letter thus: "I take this opportunity to express the
satisfaction it affords me to have it in my power to comply with your
wishes," &amp;c. (14th May) making no mention of the affair at Carlshamn.</p>

<p>On the 17th Mr. Smith came on board the Victory, being desired by
Count Rosen to inquire whether, in the event of differences between
Sweden and Norway, the hostile measures of Sweden would be opposed by
Sir James, to which he replied that he was not authorised to make any
opposition to such an attack, but that he did not consider himself
justified in supporting it without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span> having instructions from
Government; at the same time Sir James received information by an
officer who had been some time a prisoner at Christian Sand,
representing that place as open to an attack in order to capture the
merchant vessels therein, as well as the flotilla.</p>

<p>It was evident that the Swedes were very intent on the possession of
Norway, either by negotiation or otherwise; but it was questionable
whether such an addition would be advisable. Sir James was of opinion
that if Norway could be rendered independent of Denmark or of any
other country, it was not improbable that the inhabitants of that
country would accede to proposals to that effect, if assured of the
support of our Government and the advantage of our trade to them. Sir
James both personally and by letter, previously to his coming on
board, had expressed to Mr. Smith that the sequestration of the
British property at Carlshamn had been by no means satisfactorily
explained, and requested that an account of this apparently
unjustifiable measure should be speedily given, assuring them that
nothing short of the full restitution of the property would be
accepted, and requiring that his strongest remonstrances should be
transmitted to Stockholm without delay. The consequence was the
appearance of the Baron Tawast, who came with a flag of truce
ostensibly to treat for the exchange of prisoners, but virtually to
explain the affair of Carlshamn. The usual articles for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> the cartel
were exchanged, ratified, and published, and need not be inserted
here; but the true mission of the Swedish general will be best
understood from the following letter, which Sir James wrote
immediately after the conference.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Victory, in Wingo Sound, 23rd May 1811.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I request you will please to inform the Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty that Major-General Baron Tawast, commander-in-chief of the
Swedish forces at Gothenburg and the coast adjacent, in the absence of
his excellency Count Essen, having yesterday come on board his
Majesty's ship Victory, under a flag of truce, for the purpose of
entering into an arrangement with me for the exchange of prisoners,
and other points connected with the present state of affairs between
our respective nations, informed me, that he was instructed to
communicate to me, in the most confidential manner, that it was the
earnest wish of the Swedish Government to keep up the most amicable
terms with Great Britain; and that it was not intended, under any
circumstances, to commit any acts of hostility whatever; that the
supplies of water and fresh provisions for the use of the squadron
should be facilitated both at Hano Bay and Gothenburg, for which
purpose picquets should be withdrawn from the points the most
convenient for these articles to be received; that the correspondence,
both by post or by courier, should be continued unmolested; and that,
in the event of any British subjects being made prisoners on any part
of the coast, they would be immediately liberated, for which purpose
the cartel intended to be ratified had been proposed. That the
appearance of any hostile measure was only intended for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
demonstration, and in order to elude the vigilance of French spies,
who might be dispersed in the country.</p>

<p>With respect to the late transaction at Carlshamn in landing the
cargoes from the Russian or Danish vessels, it was in retaliation for
the Swedish property sequestered last year in the ports of those
nations, but that the measure was not intended to operate against
merchandise belonging to British merchants under any other flag, the
whole of which would be secured, and the underwriters, <i>secretement</i>,
indemnified for the value of the cargoes that were insured in England.</p>

<p>I strongly represented to Baron Tawast that the merchandise and
colonial produce on board the Russian vessels were positively the
property of British merchants trading to the Baltic, under licences
from one of his Majesty's principal Secretaries of State, and which
had been left in one of the ports of Sweden upon the strength of the
declaration made to me in the month of November last year, that the
property of British merchants would be secured to them,
notwithstanding the imperious necessity which Sweden had been under of
declaring war against England; and that his Majesty's Government would
doubtless expect the same to be restored; or that the merchants would
be indemnified for the full value of the cargoes landed from the
vessels under the Prussian flag; and I requested him to put in writing
what were the real intentions of the Swedish Government upon that
subject; but this he positively declined, nor would he allow Mr.
Consul Smith, who was present when this discussion took place, to
insert any part of it in writing. I signified to Baron Tawast, for the
information of the Swedish Government, that it was far from my
intention to commit any act of hostility against Sweden, and that I
was confident it was the wish of my Government to keep upon an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
amicable footing as long as circumstances would possibly admit; that I
received instructions to allow the coasting trade of Sweden to pass
unmolested, and that I had reason to hope it might be extended to the
ports in Swedish Pomerania, on which the Baron laid so great a stress,
but that I was very apprehensive that the late measures adopted
against the British property at Carlshamn, and the want of more
satisfactory explanations than he appeared instructed to make to me
upon that subject, could not fail being very ill received by my
Government.</p>

<p>Baron Tawast was particularly solicitous that the communication which
he made to me should be considered in the strictest confidence, and
expressed his hopes that the whole of the conference would be kept a
profound secret, which I assured him I should take particular care to
signify in the statement I transmitted for the information of
Government.</p>

<p class="left65">I have, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</p>

<p>To J.W. Croker, Esq.<br />
<span class="i2">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</span></p></div>

<p>On the 24th May, the Author being sent confidentially by the Admiral
to insist on some written document to explain the views of the Swedish
Government in the sequestration of British property at Carlshamn, he
obtained a promise, in presence of Mr. Smith, that the demand should
be complied with after the arrival of the Stockholm post that evening;
and accordingly on the following day the Baron Tawast transmitted what
he termed the substance of his verbal communication with Admiral
Saumarez.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>1. That the ships under Prussian colours loaded with colonial produce
were detained as reprisals for Swedish ships detained and confiscated
in Prussian ports.</p>

<p>2. That the same step has been taken with the Danish ships, in
consequence of their having captured vessels belonging to Sweden.</p>

<p>3. That Sweden has been forced by imperious demands to confiscate all
colonial produce found at Carlshamn under whatever flag, that the
cargoes are put into safe stores, and that the ships are permitted to
depart paying nothing, and that these steps are taken to avoid great
inconvenience and to hope for better times.</p>

<p>4. We engage to indemnify all merchandise insured in England,
therefore, only those merchants who have neglected to insure will
lose.</p>

<p>5. Colonial produce belonging to Swedish subjects will not be seized
or confiscated.</p>

<p>6. Ships having made false declarations, and found loaded with warlike
stores, will be confiscated, as also in time of peace.</p>

<p>7. It is engaged to give every possible facility for watering and
supplying the English fleet with provisions: the same shall be given
to Admiral Reynolds at Hano.</p></div>

<p>The above explanations stating the substance of the conference,
according to Baron Tawast, being by no means satisfactory to Sir
James, and indeed at variance with what he had inferred from it, he
wrote the following letter to Mr. Smith:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Victory, in Wingo Sound, 25th May 1811.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of this date,
enclosing Baron Tawast's explanations of the late<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> transactions at
Carlshamn. With regard to the first article, it does not appear that
any indemnification is held out for the property landed from the
vessels under the Prussian flag at Carlshamn, which is represented as
an act of retaliation for similar cargoes, belonging to Sweden, having
been confiscated in the Prussian ports. Neither does the 4th article
hold out any indemnification but to such property as may have been
insured in England, it stating that the loss would fall only upon
those merchants who have neglected to insure their cargoes. I request
you will be pleased to report to Baron Tawast, what I had before the
honour of stating to him, that Government will naturally expect that
the British merchants will be indemnified for whatever property
belongs to them which has been landed from vessels in Sweden, trading
under licences from one of his Majesty's principal Secretaries of
State, at the same time informing him that I shall transmit by the
earliest opportunity to Government, under strict secrecy, a copy of
the document you enclosed to me, and you will also be pleased to
express to him my acknowledgments for the facility with which the
supplies are proposed to be conveyed to the squadron at this anchorage
and in Hano Bay.</p>

<p class="left65">I have, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">James Saumarez.</p>

<p>To J. Smith, Esq. Gothenburg.</p></div>

<p>Sir James at the same time enclosed the document to the Secretary of
the Admiralty, as a confidential communication to the Board. He also
wrote a private letter to Mr. Yorke, which we prefer inserting, as it
gives a more full and explicit detail of all the circumstances of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
transaction, and because it is an answer to the following letter from
him which precedes it, and which was received by Sir James at that
moment.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Admiralty, 21st May 1811.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I had the honour to receive your letters of the 3rd, 4th, and 11th
inst. and am glad to hear that the first divisions of your squadron
made so favourable a passage to their rendezvous in Wingo Sound. The
four ships with Linzee, which have been ready for some days, have been
detained by the strong easterly winds; and though they sailed from St.
Helen's the day before yesterday, I should not wonder to hear that
they have put back again. Impetueux is getting forward, and we shall
send her to you as soon as we can spare her from the reserve. Fisguard
ought to be ready, but is to call at Deal for M. de Begenhas, Minister
from Portugal to Russia, whom you will have the goodness to land as
well as you can at Gothenburg, that he may find his own way forward.</p>

<p>I think we ought not to listen for a moment to any Swedish projects on
Norway; my own opinion is that Bernadotte is playing us false, and at
any rate I, for one, should dread to see a consolidation of the
Swedish and Norwegian power, such as it is, in his, or indeed in any
hand.</p>

<p>Since the arrival of the accounts of the landing the cargoes at
Carlshamn, and the accompanying measures, considerable distrust
appears to prevail here about alternate views of the Swedish
Government. A little more time will develop their plans in all
probability; in the mean time it seems very desirable that the bulk of
your efficient force should remain where it is (in the Sleeve) to be
ready to receive the requisite orders. Admiral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span> Young has taken his
station off West Cassel, and has fifteen sail of the line. Enemy,
eleven in the Scheldt, three in Texel, and two at Helvoet. When the
Impetueux joins, you will have eighteen, which is as many as we shall
be able to give you for some time at least.</p>

<p>The public letters will have apprised you of the views of the Board of
Trade and of the Government in the several points on which it was
important that you should be informed. The Swedes should be gently but
steadily convinced that it is in our power to resent this ill usage,
and to turn the consequence of perfidy on the inventors; but the evil
day should be postponed as long as possible and every practicable
chance should be given them of remaining in the right path.</p>

<p>Accounts have been received this morning from Oporto via Bristol in
eight days, which give us reason to suppose that Massena has had a
good beating near Almeida on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th inst., and has been
obliged to retire towards Salamanca, with the loss of four thousand
killed, and seven hundred prisoners. The British loss is stated at
twelve hundred. It is very probable, as when the last accounts came
away a battle was shortly expected.</p>

<p class="smcap">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I have received the honour of your letter of the 21st, and I beg to
assure you that I shall pay particular attention to that part of it
which relates to the measures to be pursued with this country. With
the exception of the affair at Carlshamn, which took place previously
to my arrival, nothing has occurred to cause any interruption to the
same intercourse as was held last year. The usual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> supplies are
continued, and the places pointed out whence they can be most readily
received. There certainly appears great prevarication on the part of
the Swedish Government relative to the property landed from the
neutral vessels at Carlshamn; and in an object of such importance, I
beg to suggest the expediency of one or two persons, duly authorised
by the merchants and underwriters concerned in the Baltic trade,
repairing to Stockholm for the purpose of asserting their claims, and
seeing how far this Government may be disposed to indemnify them for
the property sequestered. The sooner such a measure is adopted the
better, as should it be delayed, and any alteration take place betwixt
the two Governments, the whole will be lost. From what passed between
Baron Tawast and myself, I have reason to believe that Sweden would
accede to this proposal.</p>

<p>In my letter to the Board I have recommended that the two bomb vessels
that were intended for this station, should be expedited; their
appearance alone would have the best effect in intimidating the Swedes
to a compliance with our just demands. I am in hourly expectation of
seeing the ships from Spithead; the addition of the Impetueux will, I
hope, make us sufficiently strong in line-of-battle ships, but two or
three good frigates are much required.</p>

<p>I beg to offer you my sincere congratulations on the continued success
of the army under Lord Wellington, and I trust the accounts from Spain
will prove equally splendid.</p>

<p class="left50">With the highest regard,<br />

<p>The Right Hon. Chas. Yorke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I have received no further accounts from Mr. Smith relative
to the rupture between Russia and France, which makes me apprehend
that the reports have not been confirmed.</p></div>

<p>It now became Sir James's duty to make a strong remonstrance to the
Swedish Government. Anticipating the worst, he had made dispositions
of the force under his command, which were at least sufficient to
ensure respect. This was well known to Baron Tawast, whose visit was
probably, in addition to other objects, to ascertain whether or not
resistance could be effectually made in the event of hostile measures
being taken. The following is the remonstrance alluded to.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">His Britannic Majesty's ship Victory, Wingo Sound,<br />
30th May 1811.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honour to inform your excellency that intelligence having
been received by his Majesty's Government, that the cargoes belonging
to British subjects, and that have been insured to a considerable
amount in England, embarked in vessels belonging to Prussia, Denmark,
Mecklenburg, and other States, have been landed in Sweden by order of
the Swedish Government, under pretext of making reprisals for the
Swedish property said to have been confiscated in Prussia and
Denmark,&mdash;I have been directed to remonstrate in the strongest
manner against measures so deeply affecting the interest of his
Majesty's subjects, and at the same time to signify to the Swedish
Government that I cannot permit such proceedings, under whatever
pretext they may be disguised, and that if acts of so injurious a
tendency are persevered in, I shall be obliged to depart from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> that
indulgent course I have hitherto pursued towards Sweden.</p>

<p>In requesting your excellency will be pleased to make known the above
communication to your Government, I beg to renew the assurances of the
perfect consideration with which I have the honour to be, Sir, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="right smcap">James Saumarez.</p>

<p>To his Excellency M. General Baron de Tawast,<br />
<span class="i1">Commander-in-chief,&amp;c. Gothenburg</span>.</p></div>

<p>Baron Tawast's reply to this letter was a simple assurance that no
hostile act was intended, and that the Swedish Government had been
compelled to act as it had done. He had no doubt but eventually the
English merchants would be indemnified, and he trusted that Sir James
would not insist on sending his remonstrance to Government as he had
no doubt that Baron Von Essen, who was expected in a few days, would
explain all to his satisfaction, and that a rupture would thereby be
avoided. The same assurances were given to Mr. Consul Smith, but their
proceedings had so evidently the appearance of gaining time that Sir
James firmly insisted that his remonstrance should be transmitted to
Government through the medium of Baron Essen, and in reply to a note
from Consul Smith and Baron Tawast he wrote the following:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Victory, in Wingo Sound, 6th June 1811.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I request you will signify to Baron Tawast, that I can have no
objection to the letter I had the honour to address<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> to him on the
30th ultimo being communicated to the Swedish Government through the
means of his Excellency Count Essen; but having received directions
from England to make the remonstrance it contained on the very
unexpected measures adopted against the property of the British, I
hold it my indispensable duty to require that it should be transmitted
to the Government at Stockholm.</p>

<p>It could never be expected by this country that England would pass
with indifference a measure so seriously affecting the interests of
British merchants; and Government will naturally expect some
satisfactory explanation upon the subject. Those made to me by Count
Rosen and Baron Tawast have been transmitted without delay, and I hope
those in reply to the remonstrance I have made by order of Government
will prove of a satisfactory nature.</p>

<p class="left65">I have, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">James Saumarez.</p>

<p>To J. Smith, Esq., Gothenburg.</p>

<p> P.S.&mdash;You will be pleased to signify to his Excellency Count
Rosen and General Baron Tawast, that I have not replied to the
confidential communications they have done me the honour to make, as
you would more fully convey to them any sentiments upon the subject to
which they relate, and at the same time express to them my most ardent
hope that the amicable intercourse that has existed between both
countries, may not be interrupted by the present unfortunate
altercation.</p>
<hr class="c15" />

<p class="right">His Britannic Majesty's ship Victory, in Wingo Sound,<br />
6th June 1811.</p>

<p>Vice-admiral Sir James Saumarez has the honour to signify to M.
General Baron Tawast that he has lost no time in transmitting to his
Government the note his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span> excellency has been pleased to address to him
on the 4th inst. in reply to his letter of the 30th ultimo,
remonstrating by order of his Government against the late measures
pursued in Sweden upon the British property landed from the neutral
vessels in the Swedish ports, and which Baron Tawast was requested to
communicate to his Government.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the reasons assigned by Baron Tawast for wishing to
delay transmitting to Stockholm the remonstrance above mentioned, the
Vice-admiral thinks it his indispensable duty (having received
instructions from his Government to that effect) to request that it
should be communicated either through the means of his Excellency
Count Essen, or direct to the Ministers at Stockholm, according as
Baron Tawast may judge most advisable; and the Vice-admiral hopes that
the reply from the Swedish Government will be of a nature to convince
England of the uprightness of its intentions in the proceedings
adverted to, and that the amicable course hitherto pursued will meet
with no further interruption.</p>

<p>The Vice-admiral requests Baron Tawast will receive the assurance of
his perfect consideration.</p></div>

<p>At the same time Sir James sent a detail of his proceedings to the
Admiralty, with a disposition of the fleet, which was now prepared for
the worst. He recommended that proper persons should be sent to Sweden
for the purpose of making claims for the merchants and underwriters,
and he also desired that bomb-vessels might be sent to him, which
would show that his remonstrance was serious. By letters from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> Mr. Foy
at Stockholm, and from Mr. Consul Fenwick at Helsingburg, Sir James
learnt that the amount of property confiscated at Carlshamn amounted
to 500,000<i>l.</i>, about half of which was insured; that the measure of
confiscation was very unpopular in Sweden, but that every one relied
on his moderation and forbearance. From this time forward the
situation of Sweden was extraordinary beyond precedent, as fully
represented in the following extract of a letter which the Swedish
Admiral Krusenstjerna subsequently wrote to the Author:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>I know nothing, says he, of politics, but I find our situation very
singular. Our <i>friends</i> the French and Danes express their friendship
to us with unremitted zeal in capturing and robbing from us our
merchant vessels, whilst our <i>enemies</i> the English let them pass
unmolested from one port to another. We did not suffer by one hundred
times as much from these two nations, the time we were at war against
them, as we do now when they call themselves our friends and allies.</p></div>

<p>The Danes, not content with attacking ships passing through the Sound
and Belt, had the audacity to send their privateers to the coast of
Sweden, only eight leagues to the southward of Wingo, where the
Victory was at anchor. Information being given of their position, a
small one was surprised and taken without resistance by two of the
Victory's boats under Lieutenants Ross<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> and Brenton. In September,
accounts were obtained that two of superior force had taken a position
among the small islands ten leagues to the southward of Gothenburg,
when Lieut. D. L. St. Clair and Mr. E. Purcell, midshipman, were
detached from the Victory in search of them. The Danes, not
calculating on the prowess of British officers and men, left their
vessels in a small creek, probably as a decoy, landed their guns, and
planted them on an eminence which commanded them, and on the approach
of the Victory's boats had promised themselves the capture of a part
of the crew and the boats of the English commander-in-chief. But
Lieutenant St. Clair, to the astonishment of the enemy, pushed
directly for the battery, and ascending the hill gallantly stormed and
carried it at the point of the sword, the Danes having fled on the
approach of the assailants. Few prisoners were made, but both
privateers were taken and carried to the Victory on the following
morning.</p>

<p>Sir James duly appreciated the bravery of these officers, and having
represented their gallant conduct to the Lords of the Admiralty,
Lieut. St. Clair was promoted to the rank of commander, and
subsequently employed in the Baltic and coast of Spain. Mr. Purcell,
who had particularly distinguished himself, was made Lieutenant, and
is now a Captain of the Royal Navy.</p>

<p>Sir James's remonstrances had at length the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> desired effect. After
several confidential interviews which the Author had with Count Rosen,
it was agreed that the Count should come privately on board the
Victory, to explain everything to the commander-in-chief, which he did
on the 25th of June. The following letter to Mr. Yorke will show the
happy result of Sir James's wise conduct and well-timed firmness in
this important crisis.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Victory, Wingo Sound, 26th June 1811.</p>
<p class="smcap">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>If I could have had any further doubts upon my mind relative to the
sincerity of the intentions of this Government, they have been
perfectly removed by the conversation I had yesterday with Count
Rosen, who came on board the Victory, by desire of the Crown Prince,
in consequence of my remonstrance upon the affair at Carlshamn, as
will appear by my public letter. Count Rosen assured me that it was
the earnest desire of the Crown Prince to render Sweden independent of
France whenever he could do so consistent with her security, but they
are so apprehensive that, in the event of the difference between
Russia and France being settled, Bonaparte will bring that country to
act against Sweden, they dare not openly avow that sentiment. I
informed Count Rosen that so long as Sweden acted up to the system he
mentioned to be intended towards England, I had every reason to
believe that his Majesty's Government would be satisfied with it; but
that if it should be deviated from, I had the authority, and they
might be assured I would exert the utmost in my power to resent any
aggression on the part of Sweden, with which he was perfectly
satisfied, and informed me that he would communicate to the Crown
Prince precisely what I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> stated to him. There have been very serious
commotions in Scania on account of the conscriptions, wherein several
of the peasantry have lost their lives, and about three thousand
guards under the Prince, and a strong body of troops, have been
ordered to that province to restore order. I have had the honour to
receive your letter of the 14th by the Impetueux, and since that one
of the 8th, with a commission for Mr. Delisle, for which I beg to
return my thanks.</p>

<p class="left65">I have, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">James Saumarez.</p>

<p>To the Right Hon. Chas. Yorke,<br />
<span class="i2">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</span></p></div>

<p>Soon after this letter was despatched, Sir James received information
that Russia had determined not to accede to the terms of Bonaparte,
and that a rupture was likely to take place; the situation of Sweden,
therefore, became every day more critical. She had now to determine
whether she would throw herself into the arms of France for
protection, or still depend on England for independence, Had
hostilities actually commenced, the former would, doubtless, have been
her decision, and it is impossible to say what might have been the
consequences. On the one hand the restoration of Finland was the
probable result of an alliance with France, while the whole force of
Russia was employed in repelling the invaders; and on the other hand,
Norway might be added, as an indemnification for the loss of
Pomerania.</p>

<p>Trusting in the honour of the British Admiral,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> the Crown Prince of
Sweden did not hesitate to place the most implicit confidence in Sir
James. The negotiation for a treaty of peace, and for a coalition
against the tyrant of France, only wanted the presence of an
accredited Plenipotentiary to make it complete.</p>

<p>The Oberon sloop of war arrived with an officer of distinction, who
proceeded through Sweden to the Continent, and soon after several
Russian noblemen arrived from St. Petersburg with despatches of
importance. The despatches received by the Oberon contained
instructions respecting the affair of Carlshamn; and notwithstanding
the opinions and assurances of Sir James to the contrary, the
Ministers continued to suspect the Crown Prince of Sweden to be
insincere. Being, however, still desirous of remaining at peace with
Sweden, Sir James continued his friendly and courteous policy. The
bomb-ships he sent for had arrived, and his force, both within and
without the Baltic, being formidable, gave Sweden a good excuse for
not proceeding to hostilities, although she had declared war.</p>

<p>Sir James having declared that he "would not fire the first gun,"
things went on as usual, and the restrictions which he found necessary
to put on the Swedish trade, to prevent supplies being thrown into
Norway, was also a good proof to Bonaparte that Sweden was not
favourable to England.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span> During this summer the Tartar frigate was
lost, and two gun-brigs were captured by the Danes, from whom several
privateers and gun-boats were taken, and an exchange of prisoners was
made. At length it was communicated that war between France and Russia
was inevitable, and Sweden having refused to permit French troops to
pass into Norway, ostensibly for the invasion of Scotland, determined
to join England; but it was advisable to keep this state of affairs a
profound secret.</p>

<p>In the mean time the negotiations for an offensive and defensive
alliance continued, and were ready for ratification when the Oberon
arrived with Mr. (now Sir Edward) Thornton. This ship, on leaving
Portsmouth, was supposed to be bound for the West Indies, and letters
were actually on board her for the Leeward Islands; but on opening her
sealed orders, Capt. Murray, her commander, found he was destined for
Gothenburg, and that he was to have no communication on his passage
with any other ship. Being unacquainted with the coast of Sweden, and
having no pilot on board, his ship unfortunately ran on shore in a
thick fog; the guns were thrown overboard, and every exertion made in
vain to get the ship off. It is scarcely possible to describe the
anxiety of Mr. Thornton (who had been hitherto supposed to be a
passenger for the West Indies) until the morning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span> gun of the Victory
informed them that their ship was on the rocks to the northward of
Wingo Beacon, over which the flag of the Victory (white at the fore)
could be plainly distinguished, and in an hour afterwards he was safe
in the Admiral's cabin.</p>

<p>The utmost caution was still necessary in communicating with Count
Rosen, and so strictly were the orders given by the commandant of the
castle complied with, that several attempts to get Mr. Thornton on
shore were unsuccessful. He was at length smuggled into the fort as a
servant of the Author, who had, from his knowledge of the Swedish
language, no difficulty in passing the gates as a Swedish officer.
Thus were all differences happily adjusted: it was determined to keep
up the appearance of war without committing any act of hostility on
either side.</p>

<p>We shall now turn to the situation of the fleet. Admiral Reynolds had
been stationed at Hano, which is near Matvick, where the convoys
assembled, and which were with very little loss protected through the
Belt. On the 9th of November, the St. George sailed from Hano with the
last homeward bound convoy, which had been put back by a gale on the
1st.</p>

<p>The account of the disasters that befel this unfortunate fleet, which,
as a prelude to the losses which afterwards took place, must be
interesting to every reader, will be best given from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span> lamented
Admiral's own report to Sir James, which has not before appeared in
print.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">St. George, off Nystad, bearing N.N.E. <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> E.,<br />
19th November 1811.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>It gives me inexpressible concern to inform you of the sad disaster
which has befallen his Majesty's ship St. George, bearing my flag. I
have already detailed to you, sir, the gale of the 1st instant, which
caused the merchant ships to return to Matvick for shelter, and
transmitted you convoy lists of one hundred and twenty sail, which
sailed from Hano Bay with us on the 9th instant, besides twelve more
which had no instructions.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 10th we had severe weather, and anchored between
Moen Island and Dars Head. On the morning of the 12th we weighed, and
(the wind heading us before dark) anchored off Nystad with the convoy
pretty well collected. At the close of the evening of the 15th, the
weather was remarkably fine, but about ten at night it began to blow
strong with a heavy, swell from W.S.W., and we veered to a cable and
half on the small bower. The gale increasing, we veered to two cables,
and should probably have rode the gale out safe had not a large ship
of the convoy drove athwart hawse and parted our cable. The best bower
was immediately let go, and veered to two cables, which did not check
her. We then let go the sheet anchor and gave her two cables on that
also, but she would not look at it. By this time we had shoaled our
water from ten to eight fathoms, and the fury of the gale increasing,
we continued to shoal into seven and six fathoms, when the pilots and
officers advised the cutting away the masts as the only means of
saving the ship and the lives of the people. I resisted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> their advice
for some time, in hopes that a favourable lull might bring the ship
up; but when she had drifted into a quarterless five, and still
driving before a tempest of wind and rain, I ordered the axe to be
laid to the mast, and soon after they were over the side: the ship
struck violently several times, and the rudder was torn away with a
tremendous crash. About four in the morning the strength of the gale
abated, and her shocks were less violent. Every officer and man in the
ship were now employed erecting jury-masts, hoping that by lightening
her we should be able to float her off; and at daylight I telegraphed
Captain Pater of the Cressy to prepare us a Pakenham rudder; and it
still blowing too strong for boats to come to us, I made signals for
the Rose and Bellete to anchor a cable's length from us and from each
other, upon our larboard bow, that when it moderated we might send
hawsers to them to endeavour to heave us off. Nystad now bore N.N.E.
<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> miles, and Skielbye church E.N.E., and the
ship lay in four fathoms water. On the 16th we were busily employed
rigging jury-masts. Towards the evening it moderated, and about four
in the morning of the 17th we had the cheering happiness to find she
had swung to her anchor. The hands were instantly turned to the
capstan, and we hove short on the sheet cable. The night signal was
then made for the assistance of boats, and having happily succeeded in
warping her into deep water, we made sail (with which we steered her)
with a fine breeze from the eastward, and anchored near the convoy in
eleven fathoms.</p>

<p>I have much pleasure in acquainting you, sir, that the officers and
ship's company merit my warmest praise for the constant exertions and
cheerful obedience with which they conducted themselves throughout
this distressing scene.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span> Captain Guion was unwearied and
indefatigable, and his abilities could never have been better shown
than on this trying occasion. It is no small consolation to me that in
the awful moment of the masts going over the side, and throughout the
whole terrific gale, not a man was hurt.</p>

<p>I have now, sir, to acquaint you that out of one hundred and twenty
sail which were at anchor here when the gale began, only seventy-six
are now remaining; twelve are seen wrecked upon the Danish coast and
in the enemy's possession; two ran foul of each other, and both went
to the bottom, and in the midst of the gale several of the smaller
vessels were observed dismasted, and the sea making an entire breach
over them; it is much to be feared they foundered at their anchors.
Many remaining here are so much disabled that I doubt whether they
will be able to proceed with us, although they have had every
assistance from his Majesty's ships which could be given them.</p>

<p>I am happy, sir, to tell you that the St. George has her jury-masts
rigged, and her rudder hung, and is in every respect as complete to
proceed with the convoy (the first favourable wind) as hands can make
her in our present situation.</p>

<p>Before I conclude this narrative, permit me to insert my public
acknowledgments of the prompt and timely assistance I received from
every Captain of his Majesty's ships under my orders, which
accelerated our equipment much sooner than otherwise could be
expected.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p></div>

<p>James received the above letter on the 29th of November, when he
despatched a vessel with the disastrous intelligence to England. In
his answer to Admiral Reynolds we find the following paragraph:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>Greatly as I lament the severe injury sustained on board the St.
George, and the melancholy loss of so many vessels of the convoy by
the tempestuous weather, I am fully persuaded that every possible
means, which judgment and skill could dictate, were employed by you
for the safety of his Majesty's ships and the preservation of the
convoy under such perilous circumstances, and I highly applaud the
good conduct manifested by the officers and men of the St. George
during the whole of so trying an occasion, and the alacrity and
exertions displayed by them in having jury-masts erected during the
continuance of the gale, which reflects the highest credit on Captain
Guion, for the good order and discipline preserved in the ship. I also
feel great satisfaction in observing your marked approval of the
prompt and ready assistance you received from all the Captains of his
Majesty's ships and vessels under your orders.</p></div>

<p>Accounts from Captain Dashwood informed Sir James that thirty out of
the fifty-six vessels supposed to be lost had reached Matvick with the
loss of their anchors and cables, and that he would take them under
his convoy as soon as they could be got ready to sail.</p>

<p>Admiral Reynolds received assistance from Admirals Dixon and Bertie,
who were stationed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span> in the Belt, and the St. George with her convoy
reached Wingo Sound in safety on the 2nd of December. As the season
was so far advanced, it was proposed to leave the St. George at
Gothenburg during the winter, but Admiral Reynolds entreated that he
might be permitted to navigate the ship to England, which, he said in
hearing of the Author, was "as fit to make her passage with the
assistance of another ship of the line as any in the fleet." Sir James
did not accede to his wishes until he had also taken the opinion of
Capt. Guion; and it was at length determined that she should be
attended by the Cressy, Capt. Pater, and the Defence, Capt. Atkins,
while the Hero, Capt. Newman, took charge of the convoy.</p>

<p>During the stay of the fleet in Wingo Sound, court-martials were held
on the Commanders and crews of the Manly and Safeguard gun-brigs,
which had been captured by the Danes, and the crews exchanged; also on
the boatswain of the Anholt Island, which had been considered a ship,
but as the pendant had not been flying in the island, doubts had
arisen in the minds of the members of the court, and reference was
made to the Admiralty, with a request that the law officers of the
Crown might be consulted as to the legality of holding a naval
court-martial on the accused.</p>

<p>The St. George had topmasts as lower masts, and top-gallant masts as
topmasts. Her temporary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> rudder was well fitted and secured. The
Cressy, which had towed her from the Belt, was ordered to take her
again in tow. Everything was prepared for the departure of the whole,
but the wind and weather continued unfavourable, and Sir James again
repeated his wish that the St. George should remain instead of the
Ardent, into which Sir George Hope had hoisted his flag, having orders
to remain in Wingo Sound until the Pyramus, Captain Dashwood, and
Ranger, Captain Acklom, should arrive with the last convoy, which
Captain Dashwood subsequently succeeded in bringing safely through the
Sound, much to his credit, at that late season of the year.</p>

<p>On the 18th of December the wind came from the N.E. when the whole
fleet weighed and made sail. The first squadron consisted of the
Victory, Vigo, Dreadnought, Orion, Mercury, and Snipe; the second
comprised the St. George in tow of the Cressy, the Defence, and
Bellete, and the third the convoy under the Hero and the Grasshopper;
but the wind coming too far to the northward to enable the convoy to
weather the Scaw, the signal was made from the Victory for it to
return into port. At sunset on the 19th the St. George was seen well
to windward of that dangerous headland; but it appeared that she, with
her division, bore up during the night, when the wind came to the
westward of north, as will be seen by the following account of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
proceedings of H.M.S. Cressy, given officially to Sir James by Captain
Pater.</p>

<p>On the night of the 19th December, lost sight of the Victory,
Dreadnought, Vigo, and Orion. On the 20th at half past eight <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
signal from the St. George to wear; at ten <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> the St. George cast
off the tow rope; moderate breezes and hazy weather; hauled up to the
S.E. to get soundings on the Jutland shore, in order to round the Scaw
the better. During the night fresh breezes and hazy weather; a strong
current from the S.W. setting to the N.E. swept the squadron close to
Salö beacon, on the Swedish coast. On the morning of the 21st light
airs and hazy, a strong current setting about north at the rate of
three miles per hour: very great difficulty in keeping the ships from
falling on the rocks, they not being further than three miles off,
with a heavy swell right on, and no wind to command the ships, or stem
the current. Telegraph from the St. George to the Cressy about half
past eleven, <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> "What shall we do this night?" Cressy's answer, "In
a few minutes I will give my opinion." At three quarters past eleven,
<span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, telegraph from Cressy to St. George, "Anchor in Salö if
possible." About noon got a Swedish pilot from Salö, brought by the
Bellete. At one <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> a strong breeze sprung up from N.N.E. and N.E.
St. George, Cressy, Defence, and Bellete made sail (close-reefed the
topsails, reefed courses, top-gallant masts struck) to the westward,
and continued our course all night through the Sleeve. St. George
steered and sailed very well about five knots per hour. At ten <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> the 22nd, saw the land on the lee beam, distance eight leagues;
made the same known to the St. George. At half-past eleven made the
signal to the St. George for the Holmes, bearing S.S.W. distance six
or seven leagues. At four <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Bovenbergen bore south about seven
leagues; stood to the westward all night; moderate weather, wind about
N. or N. by W. On the 23rd, at nine <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, Cressy to the St. George by
signal, "Shall I take you in tow?" answered with the negative flag:
observed one of her rudder guys gone, and the people repairing it.
Wind had shifted to N.W. by W. the squadron wore about seven hours
thirty minutes <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> and stood to the N.E., with a view to open the
Sleeve, the weather appearing to indicate a gale of wind from that
quarter. At ten <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> strong gales and squally with rain; St. George
close-reefed courses and topsails, then stood to the N.E. At half-past
eleven <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> very strong gales split our foresail; St. George took in
topsails and courses. At one <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> strong gales; St. George set her
foresail. At half-past two <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> strong and heavy squalls of wind and
rain from the N.W. with a heavy sea; observed the St. George to labour
very much and roll very deep. St. George shortened all sail except the
mizen-staysail and try-sail; St. George drifting to leeward so much as
to oblige us to bear up three or four times in a watch, each time one
mile, or three quarters at least, in order to keep to leeward of her;
the land of Bovenbergen on her lee bow about three points, the Holmes
right a head of her. The wind had at four <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> shifted to the N.N.W.;
the land on her lee beam, nine leagues, was that part of Jutland a few
miles to the southward of Bovenbergen. At eight o'clock the Horn Reef,
bearing S.S.W. distance forty miles; at this time a tremendous heavy
sea was setting on the shore in the direction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> of E.S.E. At six lost
sight of the Bellete; the last sight we had of the Defence she was
standing with her head in shore, E.N.E. under storm mizen-stay-sail
and try-sail. At nine <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> the gale still increasing; St. George, as
before, drifting about N.E. or N.E. by E. with storm mizen-stay-sail
and try-sail only, appearing from some cause to be unable to wear, as
she never attempted it, although it was the most safe and profitable
tack to be upon, there being no possibility of getting off on the
larboard tack, but on the contrary must inevitably go on shore; this I
particularly remarked with great anxiety and concern from three
o'clock that afternoon, and was constantly in expectation of his
wearing, and carrying what sail he could on the starboard tack, in
order, if possible, to clear the Horn Reef: although the clearing of
the reef might be doubtful, it was the only chance left, and would at
least have given him a longer drift; but from his not doing so, I am
of opinion <i>his masts had complained and were unable to carry any more
sail</i>, as well as the rudder, which certainly wanted securing. At ten
<span class="smcap">p.m.</span> as no steps were taken by the St. George to wear, and finding
from our soundings and reckoning we were only nine leagues from the
land on our lee beam, that we could not possibly clear the land on the
larboard tack, and having drifted so far to the eastward, it became a
doubt whether we should be able to clear the Horn Reef, and that there
was no time to lose, on which to resolve either to cut away all our
masts and try to hold on by our anchors, after having run into shoal
water, which we have reason to believe was nearer than our reckoning
gave us. Had we taken such a step our success would have been very
doubtful, although we might previously have cut away our masts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span> and
made the ship a complete wreck for that purpose, as we had only two
bower anchors and two cables on each, (the bower cables in each being
half worn,) no spare anchor to trust to, the sheet anchor being broken
in the shank, and only an old worn-out bower cable (kept to be
surveyed) which was bent to it. The Defence, I believe, was
differently situated in this respect; but that is a mere conjecture.
Thus the situation of the Cressy was very alarming, which had most
sensibly struck every individual on board; the officers particularly,
who had been so strongly impressed with our perilous situation for
some time before, lamenting and verbally stating to me their opinion
of our inability and impossibility of being able to render any service
to the St. George, even in any way whatever, risk the Cressy as much
as I would. I desired them all to consult and let me know their
opinion in writing, which they did in the accompanying hasty scrawl:
No. 1, delivered about ten o'clock, and No. 2, about quarter before
eleven. Their sentiments and opinion being the same as my own on the
subject, namely, that we could not be of any service to the St. George
or to any person on board, whatever might be her fate under the
existing circumstances, and that our destruction was certain if we
lost any time in getting on the other tack,&mdash;I then (after having
ordered every thing to be ready to cut away our masts) embraced the
alternative to wear and carry sail to save the ship, which I did at
half-past ten <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> and passed close to the St. George with our reefed
fore-sail only, in order to induce him to wear, and give him the
opportunity of signifying his wish for me to remain with him, if he
did not approve of what we did, which he might have done by four
lights, in a diamond signal No. 30, or by firing three guns, also
night signal No. 30, "Keep your wind on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> larboard tack." Heavy and
severe as the gale was, there was considerable light, as we had a
moon; although not seen, yet it enlightened the atmosphere so as to
enable us to see every mast, sail, or any object that was above her
hammocks: we were so close in passing, that we could in moderate
weather, at such a distance, have conversed with great ease; and were
about a quarter of an hour in passing her; so that his not making any
signal, and his still keeping the St. George's head on the same tack,
I considered I had his approbation to use every endeavour to clear the
land and save the ship from being wrecked on the lee shore.</p></div>

<p>The remainder of Captain Pater's narrative need not be given, as it
relates only to the proceedings in his own ship, and his arrival in
the Downs on the 30th December; neither need we give the opinions
alluded to, as they are a repetition of that of the Captain, and
signed by the five lieutenants, the master, the pilot, and the purser.
The first account of the wreck of the St. George and Defence was
received by a flag of truce, sent by the Danish General Tellequist
from Randers, that on the night between the 23rd and 24th of December,
a few miles to the southward of the Holmes, the fatal catastrophe took
place. The Danish commander-in-chief, after expressing much sympathy
and feeling on the sad disaster, informs Captain Maurice that the
bodies of Captain Atkins and other officers had been found and
interred with military honours, but they had not then discovered the
body of the Admiral.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> It appeared from the account of the survivors,
eighteen in number, (twelve belonging to the St. George and six to the
Defence,) that the St. George struck about one o'clock on the morning
of the 24th, and soon afterwards the Defence, a short distance to the
northward of her. The anchors in both ships were immediately let go,
and the masts cut away; the St. George came for a short time head to
wind. About four she parted in the middle; the sea making a fair
breach over the ships, many of the crew were washed overboard, while
others were killed or frozen to death where they had tied themselves
to the weather-railing, among whom were the Admiral and his young and
gallant friend Captain Guion. It is related that one tremendous sea
struck the Defence with such inconceivable force that it lifted the
spare anchor out of its berth, threw it upon end, and in its fall it
killed about thirty men! The fury of the waves had swept all before
them; two of the men were saved in a little Norway yawl belonging to
the Author, which his lamented friend Captain Guion had offered to
take home for him, and which was the only boat that reached the shore;
some were saved on the poop of the St. George when torn from her about
five o'clock.</p>

<p>Captain Atkins and Mr. Royston, Secretary to the Admiral, were both
picked up by the Danes ere life was quite extinct, but all the
kindness and humane endeavours of that hospitable people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> failed in
keeping up animation. It was affirmed by the survivors of the Defence,
that on the Cressy wearing, the master went to Captain Atkins, and
reported that the St. George must inevitably be wrecked, and that
destruction would also attend the Defence if she did not follow the
Cressy! To this Captain Atkins said, "Has the Defence's signal been
made to part company?" and being answered in the negative, he replied,
"Then I will not leave him." Such heroic sentiments, however worthy of
the gallant Captain, cannot be justified when it was impossible to
render assistance, and the sacrifice not only of his own men, but the
valuable lives of seven hundred others, must have been the well-known
consequence.</p>

<p>Captain Pater's conduct became the subject of a court-martial, by
which he was honourably acquitted. Could he by staying longer with his
Admiral have rendered him any relief he never would have quitted him,
nor did he do so until it became his bounden duty to preserve his own
ship and the gallant crew he commanded.</p>

<p>From the testimony of the survivors of the St. George, who arrived on
board the Victory in April 1812, we learnt that the St. George lost
all her jury-masts and rudder before midnight, that she was many hours
in nine fathoms water, and that the anchors were not let go until she
struck the ground. We do not mean to argue on the probability,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> if she
had anchored, that she would have brought up or rode out the gale, but
after masts and rudder were gone, surely there was a chance. We
mention it to call the attention of those who may be at some future
period in a similar situation, and as a circumstance which appears by
the following extract of a letter to have struck Sir James, who had
often successfully depended on his anchors under trying occasions.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>After a minute perusal of Captain Pater's narrative, I cannot but
express my serious apprehension for the safety of the St. George upon
so dangerous a coast and under such perilous circumstances; at the
same time there still exists a hope that she may have been brought up
at her anchors, and weathered the severity of the gale, of which I
fervently pray their lordships may soon receive information.</p></div>

<p>We have dwelt longer on the mournful subject than we intended to do,
in consequence of opinions having been entertained that Sir James had
not consulted Admiral Reynolds and Captain Guion on the subject of the
return of the St. George from Gothenburg, and that therefore some
blame might be attached to him as commander-in-chief. Now, we are not
only able from personal knowledge to contradict these reports, but to
assure our readers that the opinions of these experienced and gallant
officers were actually taken, and likewise those of Captains Pater and
Atkins, immediately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> on the arrival of the ship at Gothenburg. The
fleet having been detained at Wingo Sound by storms and westerly winds
until the 18th, Admiral Reynolds repeatedly entreated Sir James to
permit the ship to cross the North Sea, and in a conversation the
Author had with Captain Guion, there was in his opinion not the
smallest doubt of her capability of performing the voyage. So well did
she sail that she beat many of the ships of the convoy that sailed at
the same time, and on the morning of the 19th she was still in sight
of the squadron. The loss of the Hero and her convoy, on the Hawk
Sands off the Texel, took place on the same disastrous night, and with
no less fatal consequences.</p>

<p>It appears from letters received from Sir George Hope, that this
convoy returned to Wingo Sound in obedience to signals from the
Victory, but sailed on the 21st with the same breeze, which induced
the St. George to leave Salö. She succeeded in getting out of the
Sleeve, and having a fair N.W. gale, unfortunately shaped her course
too far to the eastward. Captain Newman and all the crew, excepting
about forty men, perished.</p>

<p>The account of this event, having been published by Capt. Brenton and
other naval historians, need not be further dwelt on. The loss of the
three ships and convoy, as well as that of the Saldanha, in which not
less than five thousand men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> perished, was made a question in the
House of Commons, when Mr. Yorke, first Lord of the Admiralty, touched
on the mournful subject with so much feeling that it drew forth an
elegant and well-merited expression from Mr. Whitbread, who observed,
that "the calamities were the effect of misfortune alone, and that it
was a consolation to reflect that no blame could be imputed to any
one."</p>

<p>Although Sir James was conscious that such was really the case, it
need scarcely be added that his mind was deeply affected when the
melancholy news arrived, nor could he for many months conceal his
affliction.</p>

<p>The last convoy under Captain Dashwood of the Pyramus, arrived safely.
Instead of passing through the Belt as intended, he availed himself of
a strong S.S.W. wind, and boldly pushed through the Malmö Channel, led
by the Ranger, Captain Acklom, who so much distinguished himself on
this occasion as to gain his promotion to the rank of post-captain as
a reward for his services.</p>

<p>This convoy consisted of one hundred and twenty sail, leaving only
twelve vessels at Carlshamn, which were a part of the St. George's
convoy that could not obtain anchors and cables. They were off
Falsterbo on the 20th of December, when the wind, which had been
northerly, shifted to the S.W.; on the 23rd they reached Elsineur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
Roads, and on the 28th Gothenburg, whence they sailed in company with
Rear-admiral Hope in the Ardent, who had thus finished the service of
the Baltic for the season.</p>

<p>Colonel Dornberg, who had been employed on the Continent
confidentially, had ascertained that Prussia would be forced to join
France against Russia, therefore the Government transports with arms
intended for their assistance were sent back, and formed part of the
Hero's unfortunate convoy.</p>

<p>The Victory, after parting with the St. George, was detained by
baffling winds and thick weather. Fortunately on the 21st good
altitudes of the sun were obtained for the chronometers, and thereby
the situation of the fleet was determined before the storm began on
the 22nd: at noon it blew a strong gale from N.W. (by compass);
Leostoff bore N. 31, W. 203 miles, the Texel S. 136 miles; but an
allowance of two points was made for what was called <i>indraft</i>, and
the course steered was S.W. by W. On the 23rd the storm increased with
inconceivable violence: the Victory was scudding under close-reefed
main-top-sail. At noon the signal was made for longitude, when it
appeared that the reckoning of the whole fleet was much to the
westward of the Victory, particularly the Vigo, no less than
eighty-four miles; but none of the ships had observations for the
chronometers, and therefore the commander-in-chief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> determined on
running by the reckoning of his own ship; and had he not done so, the
whole fleet would have shared the fate of the Hero in the same spot!
At ten <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> soundings were struck on the broad fourteen, which cleared
up all doubts on the subject; on the next day the gale moderated, the
fleet passed the Gallopere light and anchored to stop tide; on
Christmas-day passed down Channel, and in the evening anchored in St.
Helen's.</p>

<p>I may here observe with propriety, that I have since found the
deviation from the true course, which by pilots and masters of ships
had been attributed to <i>indraft</i>, &amp;c. was occasioned entirely by the
<i>deviation</i> of the magnetic needle when steering to the S.W. the point
on which the attraction found in almost every ship was, by a series of
experiments, established to be, from one to two points; (see Ross's
voyage 1818;) while it is notorious that if the ship was standing N.E.
the opposite point, it had been always found that not only no
allowance for <i>indraft</i> was necessary, but that the error in the
reckoning was on the opposite way; and we therefore conclude that many
ships have been lost for want of making the necessary allowance for
the <i>deviation</i> of the compass in steering across the North Sea, in a
storm from N.W.</p>

<p>A correspondence was carried on with the Captains of this squadron
without leading to any satisfactory reason for the extraordinary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
errors in the reckonings of each ship, and it is mentioned here to
warn those who may be in a similar situation, and to induce them to
obtain the errors of their compasses, for which plain rules have been
given, if they are not provided with Professor Barlow's apparatus.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the Victory at Spithead, Sir James applied for leave
of absence, and arriving in town received the unqualified approbation
of Ministers, and of his Royal Highness the Prince Regent, for his
wise and firm conduct on this critical situation of affairs in the
Baltic, and for the important service he had rendered the country in
maintaining peace, and in supporting the dignity of the Crown and the
best interests of the community.</p>

<p class="p2"></p>

<p>The state of Europe at the commencement of this year left no doubt
that a severe struggle for independence was approaching. It was
evident<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> that under the pretence of conquering a maritime peace,
Buonaparte's ambition was nothing short of continental empire; his
armies had been gradually advancing, and, under various pretexts,
taking possession of every fortress in Prussia, and towards the
frontiers of Russia. Supposing himself in a position to enforce the
ruinous demands which he well knew could not be granted, he looked
forward with confidence to the subjugation of Russia, after which
Sweden would become an easy conquest. Alexander saw that the existence
of his empire depended on the exertions he was now compelled to make,
and before the conclusion of the last year, his intentions of
resistance were secretly made known both to the British and Swedish
cabinets. It was now deemed fortunate that the wise and temperate
policy of Sir James had been the means of forming that coalition,
which was subsequently the saving of Europe.</p>

<p>So important did Government consider the continuation of Sir James as
commander-in-chief in the Baltic, that while in London, at Tunbridge
Wells, and other places where he resided, the whole of the
correspondence passed through him, and as the spring advanced he was
again entreated to finish the good work he had begun. As his force was
now to consist of only ten sail of the line, he did not judge a
Captain of the fleet to be necessary; but Rear-admirals Byam Martin
and J.N. Morris were at his request<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span> appointed to serve under him, and
it may be truly added that two officers better qualified to support
his plans could not have been found.</p>

<p>Early in the spring, Captain Dashwood, who had so highly distinguished
himself in carrying a valuable convoy through the Sound at the close
of last year, was sent with a squadron of sloops to afford protection
to the island of Anholt, which was again threatened by the Danes, but
on the appearance of this detachment, the attempt, if ever intended,
was abandoned. On this service the Fly sloop was unfortunately lost on
Anholt Reef.</p>

<p>In April, Rear-admiral Morris was despatched with the advanced
squadron and arrived at Wingo Sound about the middle of April, having
been previously informed of the state of affairs in Sweden, and
instructed to keep up the appearance of hostility without committing
any positive act; in the mean time a fleet of line of battle ships was
fitting out at Carlscrona, and strict orders were issued that in the
event of their putting to sea they were not to be molested by his
Majesty's ships. A correspondence was entered into with the Danish
auditor-general respecting the exchange of prisoners, in which a
demand was made for the release of all the Danish prisoners in lieu of
all English, which would have been ten to one in favour of Denmark;
but the chief object was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> release of a Danish officer, who, after
having struck his colours, attempted to destroy his ship, contrary to
the laws and usages of war, and who had been detained in consequence.
This request was at first refused, but in consequence of the kind
treatment of the unfortunate crews who suffered shipwreck, and who
were unconditionally liberated, the exchange took place.</p>

<p>Sir James hoisted his flag in the Victory on the 14th of April, and on
the 28th sailed from the Downs. On the 3rd May he arrived at
Gothenburg, having then under his command ten sail of the line, seven
frigates, and fourteen smaller vessels. Admiral Morris, with a strong
detachment, passed through the Belt to Hanö, where he carried on the
service relating to convoys, and the prevention of troops being sent
across the Belt to the Danish islands, which were no doubt intended to
menace Sweden into compliance with the demands and views of
Buonaparte.</p>

<p>This campaign commenced with several brilliant naval actions, among
which the following is most worthy of being recorded. During the
spring the Danes had succeeded in stationing a large frigate and six
large brigs on the coast of Norway, for the purpose of attacking our
convoys in passing through the Cattegat, which, in order to protect
the trade, had obliged Sir James to station the Dictator of sixty-four
guns, and three brigs, off that part of the coast. The result cannot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
be more fully given than in the following extract of Captain Stewart's
letter to Sir James:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">H.M.S. Dictator, Sleeve, 7th July 1812.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honour to inform you, that yesterday evening being off
Mardoe, with the Podargus, Calypso, and Flamer, the mast-heads of the
squadron were seen over the rocks, and Captain Robilliard of the
Podargus, in the most handsome manner, volunteered to lead the
squadron in to attack them, he having a man on board acquainted with
the place; and as neither the pilots nor masters of either of the
ships conceived themselves equal to the charge, I did not hesitate to
accept his kind offer, well knowing the British flag would meet
nothing but honour in such hands.</p>

<p>In the entrance of the passage the Podargus unfortunately took the
ground, by which circumstance I was deprived of the valuable and
gallant services of her commander during the remainder of the day, and
was in consequence obliged to leave the Flamer to her assistance; but
in Captain Weir, of the Calypso, I found everything that could be
wished for, which in a great measure made up for the loss I had
sustained in the Podargus and Flamer.</p>

<p>By this time, seven hours thirty minutes <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> we had arrived within
one mile of the enemy, who were running inside of the rocks under a
press of sail. The Calypso, which had also grounded for a short time,
was now leading us through the passage, and both she and ourselves
engaged with the squadron and numerous gun-boats; however, at nine
hours thirty minutes, I had the satisfaction, after sailing twelve
miles through a passage in some places scarcely wide enough to admit
of our studding-sail booms being out, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span> running the Dictator's bow
upon the land with her broadside towards the enemy (within hail) as
per margin, (Nayaden, Laaland, Sams&oelig;, and Kiel,) who were
anchored with springs on their cables close together, and supported by
gun-boats, in the small creek of Lingöe, the Calypso most nobly
following us up. In half an hour the frigate was literally battered to
atoms, and the flames bursting forth from her hatchways; the brigs had
also struck, and most of the gun-boats were completely beaten, and
some sunk.</p>

<p>The action had scarcely ceased and the ship afloat, than we found
ourselves again attacked by gun-boats, which had retreated on seeing
the fate of their squadron, and were again collecting from all
quarters; but Captain Weir, of the Calypso, having taking a most
advantageous position, engaged them with the greatest gallantry and
effect. Indeed I am at a loss how to express my approbation of the
prompt exertion of this gallant and meritorious officer. The Podargus
and Flamer, in the mean time, were warmly engaged with numerous
batteries and gun-boats, both brigs being aground; but by the uncommon
exertion and extreme gallantry of Capt. Robilliard, and the officers
and crews of the brigs, they at last got afloat, very much cut up. On
this occasion Lieut. England particularly distinguished himself.</p>

<p>At three <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> having got the Dictator, Calypso, and prize brigs in the
fair way, we attempted to get out through the passage, when we were
assailed by a division of gun-boats from behind the rocks, so situated
that not a gun could be brought to bear on them from either vessel. In
this situation the prize brigs grounded, and notwithstanding every
exertion on the part of Lieut. James Wilkie of this ship, who was on
board the Laaland, and had extinguished a fire on board her, which was
burning with great fury, and Lieut. Hooper of the Calypso, in the
Kiel, we had to abandon them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span> complete wrecks, humanity forbidding us
setting them on fire, owing to the number of wounded men they had on
board.</p></div>

<p>Captain Stewart's letter concludes with the highest praise on all the
officers and men in the squadron he commanded, and subjoins a list of
nine men killed, and thirty-seven wounded and missing. The enemy
admitted that they had lost three hundred men, but it was supposed
that five hundred was nearer the number. We are sorry to record that
some of the Danish officers violated their parole and treacherously
rose on their protectors, after medical aid had been afforded them
under the sacred sanction of a flag-of-truce!</p>

<p>Sir James enclosed Captain Stewart's narrative in the following letter
to the Secretary of the Admiralty:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><span class="smcap">Sir,</span>&mdash;I have the highest satisfaction in transmitting to you, to
be laid before the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, the inclosed
letter, which I have this day received from Captain Stewart, of H.M.S.
Dictator, detailing the particulars of a most gallant exploit,
performed by him and the two sloops and the gun-brig named on the
margin (Podargus, Calypso, and Flamer,) upon the Danish frigate
Nayaden, three large sloops of war, and numerous gun-boats, within the
Rocks of Wardoe, on the coast of Norway, supported by batteries on the
shore; in which the enemy's frigate has been totally destroyed, and
the sloops of war completely disabled, besides several of the
gun-boats sunk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span> It is impossible to express in an adequate manner the
undaunted spirit displayed by Captain Stewart, and all the officers
and men under his orders, in this arduous enterprise, which, I am
assured, will be duly appreciated by their Lordships. Captain Stewart
speaks in the strongest terms of the gallantry and zeal of Captain
Robilliard, of the Podargus; Captain Weir, of the Calypso; and Lieut.
Thomas England, of the Flamer gun-brig; he also recommends Lieut.
Buchanan, first of the Dictator, to their Lordships' favourable
notice.</p>

<p class="left65">I have, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">James Saumarez.</p>
<p>J.W. Croker, Esq.</p></div>

<p>To this their lordships expressed their high approbation, and promoted
Captain Stewart, Weir, and Lieutenant England immediately, and Capt.
Robilliard soon after, for the gallantry, zeal, and judgment they
displayed.</p>

<p>The following letter from Captain J. Ross, of the Briseis, gives an
account of a gallant exploit performed by the boats of that ship.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Briseis, off Pillaw, 29th June 1812.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honour to inform you that, in pursuance of your orders, I
stood in yesterday to communicate with the merchant vessel Urania, in
Pillaw Roads, when I perceived her to be in possession of the French
troops, and that it was intended to destroy her on our approach. I
therefore tacked and stood off, judging it the most likely way to save
the ship (which was employed by Messrs. Solly and Sons on the part of
government) from destruction, and the remainder of her cargo from
falling into the hands of the enemy. I resolved, however, to surprise
her in the night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span> Lieutenant Thomas Jones, first of the Briseis, Mr.
Palmer, midshipman, and eighteen men, were sent in the pinnace on that
service. At midnight, when within pistol shot, they were hailed and
fired upon by the enemy, who had six guns and four swivels on board
the Urania, which was surrounded by craft and smaller boats; but every
obstacle was overcome by Lieutenant Jones and his crew, who gave three
cheers, boarded over the craft, and drove the enemy off deck into
their boats on the opposite side, leaving behind part of their arms.
The cable was then cut, and she was brought out, together with a
French scout, that was employed unloading her.</p>

<p>On our side I have to regret the loss of one seaman killed; the
sergeant of the Royal Marines badly wounded; Mr. Palmer, midshipman,
and one seaman, slightly wounded; but the enemy must have suffered far
more severely from being exposed in their turn to the fire from the
Urania after they had abandoned her.</p>

<p>My pen cannot do sufficient justice to the merit of Lieut. Jones, who
has on a former occasion received the approbation of the
commander-in-chief, for his gallantry and zeal; but when I leave the
plain statement of this to recommend him, I am happy in the conviction
that his valour will be duly appreciated by yourself and the
commander-in-chief. Lieutenant Jones informs me that Mr. Palmer, who
has passed for Lieutenant, behaved in the most gallant manner, and I
think him also highly deserving promotion.</p>

<p class="left65">I have the honour, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">John Ross, Commander.</p>

<p>To Rear-admiral Martin,<br />
<span class="i2">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</span></p></div>

<p>The above was transmitted by Admiral Martin to the commander-in-chief,
who, after expressing his admiration of the conduct of Lieut. Jones
and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span> the rest, forwarded the letter to the Admiralty. The following
answer was received from the Secretary:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Admiralty, 16th July 1812.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have received and laid before my Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty your letter of the 10th instant, transmitting a report from
Captain Ross, of the Briseis, of the re-capture of the merchant ship
Urania, in Pillaw Roads, by the boats of that sloop, under the orders
of Lieutenant Jones and Mr. Palmer, midshipman, and I am in reply
commanded to express their Lordships' approbation of the gallantry
displayed by the officers and men on this service.</p></div>

<p>There can be no doubt but promotion would have followed this valiant
and successful affair, but Lieut. Jones being unfortunately obliged to
return home in consequence of pressing family affairs, and having not
rejoined his ship, lost his well-merited advancement in the navy,
while Mr. Palmer obtained his promotion.</p>

<p>The Briseis was subsequently appointed to carry the joyful news of
peace to Libau, where Captain Ross was received with demonstrations of
joy. The hatred the oppressed inhabitants manifested towards their
oppressors the French, who had just vacated the place, was beyond
expression; and a Russian squadron had now ventured out of the Gulf of
Finland to join in the general rejoicing.</p>

<p>Steps were taken by the Admiral to remove the supplies of corn and
provisions at that place, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span> prevent their falling into the hands of
the advancing enemy.</p>

<p>Rear-admiral (now Admiral Sir Byam Martin, G.C.B.) was detached in the
Aboukir, his flag-ship, and a numerous squadron and flotilla, to
assist in the defence of Riga, which, as soon as war was declared,
would be exposed to the attack of Macdonald's and Oudinot's divisions
of the French army. In the mean time, peace between Great Britain and
Russia took place on the 18th July, and this happy event was announced
to the Admiral in the following letter from Mr. Thornton, General
Suchtalen having previously arrived in Sweden with full powers from
the Emperor of Russia.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Orebro, 17th July 1812.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honour of informing your excellency that I have this day
signed a treaty of peace with the Swedish and Russian
plenipotentiaries, and you will receive under this cover a packet
containing those for his Majesty's principal Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs, which I will request your excellency to deliver to
the care of a confidential officer, to be conveyed to England. Should
you think that the King's service will not be promoted by detaching a
vessel of war with him, I see no impropriety in the officer's sailing
in the packet-boat and making the best of his way to England.</p>

<p>I leave it to your excellency's judgment to give what publicity you
think proper to this important intelligence. It should, I think,
certainly be communicated to all the commanders of his Majesty's ships
in the Baltic, for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span> purpose of regulating their conduct towards
Swedish and Russian ships of war, but I know not that any alterations
ought to be made in commercial arrangements until after the
confirmations of the peace by exchange of the ratifications. I may
have opportunities of writing again on these points.</p>

<p class="left60">I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">E. Thornton.</p>

<p>To Admiral Sir Jas. Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>Sir James immediately despatched his nephew, Flag-lieutenant Dobree,
in the Drake sloop of war, with this important despatch, and with the
intelligence that the French army had passed the frontiers of Russia
on the 24th of June, being the first act of hostility. Lieutenant
Dobree arrived at the Admiralty on the 31st July, for which and other
services he was promoted to the rank of commander. In the mean time,
and in anticipation of this joyful event, Earl Cathcart had been
nominated as Ambassador to the Court of St. Petersburg, and had sailed
from England in the Aquilon.</p>

<p>Admiral Martin's arrival at Riga was extremely well-timed: his
judicious operations in concert with Generals Essen, Ems, and Lovis,
were the means of saving that city, which was in July and August
besieged by Macdonald, when General Lovis was obliged to retreat
within the walls. The suburbs were burnt rather hastily, but the
arrival of a reinforcement of both English and Russian gun-boats, not
only raised the siege, but impeded the advance of that division of the
enemy towards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span> the great scene of action in the vicinity of Moscow.</p>

<p>A well-timed feint concerted by Admiral Martin on the heel of Dantzig
had the desired effect of retarding the advancement of a strong
reinforcement, so as to prevent it reaching the main army in time to
take part in the battle of Borodino. To effect this a number of small
merchant vessels were seized in the harbour of Riga, and by the prompt
exertions of British seamen were converted into transports, on board
which were embarked four hundred troops and other people of all
classes, a sufficient part of which were clothed in regimentals to
deceive a spectator. This formidable-looking armament having entered
the Bay of Dantzig under Swedish colours, created such a degree of
alarm, as to induce the troops which were marching to join Buonaparte
to halt for no less than fourteen days, during which time
proclamations in the German and Swedish languages were landed on the
coast, while demonstrations for landing troops, ostensibly for the
purpose of an attack on the city, were occasionally made, and shells
thrown into the lower forts. After a sojourn of three weeks in the bay
the borrowed ships were sent back to Riga, and the Aboukir and part of
the squadron joined Rear-admiral Morris at Hanö, where that excellent
officer had been most successfully protecting the commerce of both
nations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span> On the 9th of October a large convoy, which had long been
detained at Matvick and Hanö, was about to sail, when it was
ascertained that several French privateers had passed through the
canal of Kiel, in order to attack it, and the Briseis was consequently
sent in the disguise of a merchant bark in advance of the convoy. The
plan succeeded; one of the privateers came alongside of the Briseis,
and was easily captured, while the other three having taken refuge
under the batteries in Hammarhus Bay, on the N.W. side of Bornholm,
were attacked and destroyed. In this affair the Briseis had her
main-mast badly wounded. Lieutenant Jones, who commanded the boats,
particularly distinguished himself; but on his approach the enemy,
having cut their cables, and run their vessels on the rocks, they were
instantly wrecked and could not be carried off.</p>

<p>Sir James had detached Captain Stewart of the Dictator with several
small vessels, to the Belt, to cut off the communication with Zealand,
and in the course of this service Lieutenants Wilkie, Douell, and
Petley particularly distinguished themselves. The Attack gun-brig was
taken, and Lieutenant Craufurd, of the Wrangler, made a gallant but
ineffectual attempt to retake her. The Mars, and Courageaux, and
Orion, had the arduous duty of protecting the trade through the Belt,
and excepting on one occasion, when five merchant vessels were driven
on shore in a storm, their efforts were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> successful. Owing partly to
the negotiations and to the expectation that an enemy's fleet might
escape from the Scheldt, the commander-in-chief was detained at Wingo
Sound, the outer Roads of Gothenburg. The merchant ships which had
been detained at that port and Carlshamn, as also the colonial produce
and other British property, had been by his firm and temperate conduct
released and sent under licence to various ports on the Continent.</p>

<p>Mr. Thornton, who had been on board the Victory on the 11th of July,
had proceeded to Orebro, where he signed the treaty of peace already
mentioned; returned on the 7th of August, sailed in the Tweed for
England on the following day, but fortunately meeting with the Aquilon
to the eastward of the Scaw, he returned with Lord Viscount Cathcart;
and after a consultation with Sir James and Count Rosen, the Governor
of Gothenburg, the ambassador set out for Orebro to ratify the
coalition of the three nations against the common enemy.</p>

<p>An expedition was now planned for an attack on Zealand, the object of
which was to force the King of Denmark to join the coalition, and
7,000 Swedes were collected; these were to be joined by 20,000
Russians; but the latter were so tardy in their motions that the plan
was abandoned, as well as another for the descent on the coast of
Norway; but the armament itself had a good effect by detaining the
troops necessary for the defence of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span> Denmark from joining the main
army of the French, while it gave a more serious aspect to the feint
made by Rear-admiral Martin in the Bay of Dantzig.</p>

<p>Soon after the ratification of peace the Swedish Monarch conferred on
Sir James the high honour of the Commander of the Grand Cross of the
Order of the Sword of Sweden,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> which corresponds to that of the
Bath in England, and the decorations were sent in the following
handsome letter from his Majesty:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="smcap">Monsieur le Vice-amiral Saumarez,</p>

<p>Mon Conseiller intime d'Etat, le Baron de Platen, se rendant auprès de
vous pour concerter sur des mesures à prendre contre l'ennemi commun,
je profite avec plaisir de cette occasion pour vous envoyer
ci-incluses les décorations de Commandeur Grand Croix de mon Ordre de
l'Epée. Les services distingués que vous avez déjà rendu à mon
royaume, et ceux que vous lui rendez maintenant, le zèle que vous avez
constamment déployé pour le succès de nos entreprises, tous ces motifs
réunis vous avaient acquis depuis longtems des droits à mon estime et
à ma reconnaissance; et j'éprouve une satisfaction toute particulière
de pouvoir vous en donner aujourdhui un gage solennel. Je vous
félicite de l'avantage remporté le 7 de ce mois par une partie de
votre escadre; et vous devez être bien persuadé, qu'il ajoute encore
au prix que j'attache à vos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span> efforts pour assurer la defense des côtes
de la Suède. Et sur ce je prie Dieu qu'il vous ait, Monsieur le
Vice-amiral de Saumarez en sa sainte et digne garde; etant votre
affectionné,</p>

<p class="right smcap">Charles.</p>

<p>Au Château de Stockholm, le 19 de Juillet 1809.</p></div>

<p>Permission to accept and wear the decorations were subsequently
granted by the Prince Regent.</p>

<p>The defeat of Oudinot at Polotzk, the junction of Begration and
Barclay de Tolly with the grand Russian army under Kutusoff, and the
battle of Borodino, gave a favourable turn to affairs, but not such as
to dispel every apprehension, and it was determined by the Emperor
Alexander to send the whole Russian fleet to winter in England.
Admiral Crown was expected from Archangel with eight sail of the line,
and Admiral Tait with ten, and six frigates from Cronstadt. The former
having sailed from Wingo before this had been determined on, it became
necessary for Sir James to delay his return. The Aquilon, which had
been sent through the Belt to meet Lord Cathcart at Dalerö, and convey
his lordship to Åbo, where he was to have a conference with the
Emperor Alexander, met with some damage and returned to Wingo.</p>

<p>Mr. James Saumarez, eldest son of the Admiral, who had accompanied his
lordship, made a tour and visited the Swedish, Finland, and Russian
capitals; he returned on board the Victory on the 9th of October, when
the afflicting intelligence arrived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span> of the sudden death of his
sister, the eldest daughter of the Admiral, whose loss was deeply
regretted by all who knew her excellent disposition. The shock, as may
be imagined, was deeply felt by Sir James; but it will be seen by the
following correspondence that his mind was supported under this severe
trial, and much as his presence was required at home he regarded his
duty to his country to be paramount to every other consideration, and
unflinchingly remained at his post. His son (the present Lord de
Saumarez) who had just finished his education for the Established
Church, was indeed a great comfort to his suffering parent.</p>

<p>In a letter, dated 13th October, to the Secretary of the Admiralty, he
says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>There has been no ship in the Hawke Roads into which I could have
shifted my flag, since the receipt of their Lordships' letter to send
the Victory to Spithead, and the present afflicting state of my
domestic concerns renders it of the utmost consequence that I should
repair to England immediately; but I have suffered my private feelings
to give way to the public service, and have to request that I may
receive their Lordships' permission to proceed to England upon the
receipt of this letter.</p></div>

<p>In his letter to Lord Cathcart, dated on the following day, he
writes,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>Although the afflicting state of my domestic concerns requires my
return to England with as little delay as possible, I sacrifice my
private feelings to a sense of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span> duty to the public service, and I
have signified to his Majesty's Government my intention to remain here
until I receive the pleasure of H.R.H. the Prince Regent upon the
above measures (respecting the Russian fleet), when I hope to receive
permission to return to England.</p></div>

<p>Sir James having given the necessary directions to Rear-admiral Morris
for sending pilots to, and conducting the Russian fleet through the
Belt, shifted his flag to the Pyramus and despatched the Victory to
England. He was preparing to sail homewards, when to his surprise
Rear-admiral George Hope arrived to supersede him; he, however, did
not give up the command until everything was completed, and until he
had received the following despatch from Lord Cathcart:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">St. Petersburg, 26th Oct. 1812.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I had the honour of receiving yesterday by the Briseis your letter of
the 10th ult., duplicates of your two letters of the 2nd, and
triplicates of your letter of the 4th.</p>

<p>I lost no time in laying the three last-named despatches before the
Emperor, and his Imperial Majesty desired me to take the first
opportunity of expressing his entire approbation of everything you
have done and promised for his squadrons, together with his best
thanks for the exertions you have made in meeting and assisting the
squadron under Admiral Crown, to refit so as to pursue the voyage to
the Baltic, as well as for supplying an officer and pilots for the
passage of the Belt.</p>

<p>His Imperial Majesty learned with great concern the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span> afflicting loss
you have sustained, and was duly sensible of the efforts you made for
the public cause, by remaining at Gothenburg under the pressure of so
much grief.</p>

<p>Admiral Crown has afforded an example of the uncertainty of
calculations of time and of meeting at sea, in regard to the sailing
of men-of-war; for this squadron outstripped all the vessels and
cruisers you sent, and, missing all the copies of the Emperor's
orders, arrived at Sweaborg, I think, on the 10th. The Emperor sent
immediate orders for this fleet to prepare to return forthwith to
Wingo. Vice-admiral Crown has sent up no details whatever to the
Minister of Marine concerning the state of the squadron, but that
minister, the Marquis Traversay, has sent a superior officer of known
activity, to hasten the supply of everything necessary for them, and
to repeat the order for the immediate sailing of the whole squadron,
or of as many ships as can be ready; the remainder to follow.</p>

<p>The wind being fair, it is expected that Admiral Tait is under sail
with a division as per enclosed list, and it is probable he may be the
first to reach you. I have not failed to communicate your idea in
regard to the road at Dantzig to the Minister of Marine.</p>

<p>The Snipe will sail with the last division, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="left50">I have the honour to be,<br />
<span class="i1">With truth and regard,</span></p>
<p class="right smcap">Cathcart.</p>

<p>To Vice-admiral Sir James Saumarez, Bart. K.B.</p></div>

<p>Here follows a list of one ship of one hundred guns, one of eighty,
five of seventy-four, and three frigates, under Admiral Tait; seven of
seventy-four, and three frigates, and four smaller vessels, under
Admiral Crown; and three of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span> seventy-four, two frigates, a brig, and
four English transports, under Rear-admiral Karobka. Sir James at the
same time received details of the proceedings at Riga, which have
already been mentioned.</p>

<p>The following passage relative to the death of his daughter is
extracted from a letter from Sir James to his brother.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>At a time I was buoying myself up with the expectation of soon
returning to England, and affording that consolation to my beloved
wife and to those dear ones whom the Almighty yet spares us, which
they so greatly need, I received despatches which rendered it
impossible for me to leave the station; I most fervently implore the
all-gracious Providence to enable me to submit to its divine decree
with patience and due resignation.</p>

<p>If I could be assured of Lady Saumarez's welfare, I should feel more
tranquil, but I know too well the keenness of her feelings. The
anxiety she suffers on my account will, I fear, put to the test her
practice of those pious virtues we all know her to possess, and of
which she sets so bright an example. James's presence is of the
greatest comfort to me, and alone enables me to make my cabin
supportable. He returned most opportunely from St. Petersburg the day
on which the news of this affliction arrived, and it was he that
communicated it to me. He was the bearer of Lord Cathcart's
despatches, which I have forwarded, for I could not spare him from me.</p></div>

<p>We shall now continue the narrative of Sir James's operations at this
eventful period, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span> the tyrant of France received his first
effectual check, followed by the disastrous retreat of the French army
from Russia, and the liberation of Europe.</p>

<p>Besides twenty thousand stand of arms which had been supplied to the
Swedish army and landed at Gothenburg, the Snipe gun-brig, Lieut.
Champion, had been sent to St. Petersburg with four transports laden
with sixty thousand stand of arms. On opening the arm-chests it was
found that they contained muskets, but no bayonets, and the
indignation of the Russians at this circumstance may be better
imagined than described, when they exclaimed, "What! do the English
think we do not know how to use the bayonet?" On searching, however,
the last ship, the bayonets were found, to the inexpressible joy of
these people; and it cannot be denied that they <i>did</i> make use of them
with fearful effect.</p>

<p>The Briseis was sent with the Admiral's last despatches to Lord
Cathcart, and Captain Ross had the honour of returning with the
important intelligence of the re-capture of Moscow, the defeat of
Murat, and that the French were in full retreat. The Russian fleet
had, however, sailed from Cronstadt and Sweaborg, and it was now too
late to stop them: the accounts reached London on the 8th of November,
and it was a satisfaction to Sir James that he had retained the
command until the overthrow of the invading army.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span> Mr. Saumarez went
home in the Aquilon, but the Admiral remained in the Pyramus at
Gothenburg until the 5th of November, at which time he had delivered
the various papers and instructions to Rear-admiral Hope necessary in
giving up the command to that officer.</p>

<p>Before leaving Sweden he was waited on by Baron Essen, aide-de-camp to
the Crown Prince, who presented him with a splendid sword, the hilt of
which was set in diamonds, and said to be worth 2000<i>l.</i>, as a
testimony of the high sense his Majesty entertained of the important
services he had rendered to Sweden and the good cause.</p>

<p>Among the many attached to the Court of Sweden, there was none who
expressed himself more emphatically than his excellency Baron Platen.
We shall give his letter, although it has already been published in
substance.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>At length I rejoice, my dear Admiral. You have been the guardian angel
of my country; by your wise, temperate, and loyal conduct you have
been the first cause of the plans which have been formed against the
demon of the Continent. He was on the point of succeeding; folly and
the want of confidence in some have made them doubt the success of the
good cause. You have shared my anxiety, but it is now all over; two
couriers have arrived this night from the head-quarters of the Emperor
and the Prince. War was declared on the 24th of July; Austria is with
us; thus, if Providence have not decided something against all
probability, Buonaparte will be defeated, humanity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span> will breathe
again, and Europe be once more raised up. With Wellingtons, Moreaus,
Bernadottes against him, what hopes! I shall not fail to communicate
to you the first news of importance, for once more I must tell you,
that <i>you</i> were the first cause that Russia had dared to make war
against France: <i>had you fired one shot when we declared war against
England</i>, all had been ended, and Europe would have been enslaved. I
own to you, also, my satisfaction that our august Prince Royal has
conducted himself in such a manner as to leave your excellency no
cause to repent of that which some people were pleased to call
"credulity," but which events have proved to be wisdom.</p></div>

<p>The expressions of the worthy and truly patriotic friends, Admiral
Krusenstjerna and Count Rosen on taking final leave of the Admiral,
were no less remarkable for sincerity and gratitude. The first has
long since paid the debt of nature, universally and justly regretted;
the latter in 1834 fell a sacrifice to his humane endeavours to arrest
the progress of cholera, and both will long be remembered as two of
the saviours of their country.</p>

<p>The Pyramus reached Yarmouth Roads on the 10th of November, when Sir
James made immediate application to strike his flag, and had the
satisfaction of receiving in answer the following letter from the
Secretary of the Admiralty.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Admiralty, 20th Nov. 1812.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty have been pleased to command
me, in transmitting to you the accompanying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span> order, to strike your
flag and come on shore, to communicate to you their marked approbation
of the zeal, judgment, and ability evinced by you during your late
command in the Baltic. Your attention to the trade of his Majesty's
subjects, and your conciliatory, yet firm conduct, towards the
Northern Powers, have met the approbation of his Majesty's Government,
and their lordships are glad to have observed that your services have
been justly appreciated by the Courts of Sweden and Russia. I beg to
add the personal satisfaction which I feel at being the channel of
communicating to you this testimony of their lordships' approbation.</p>

<p class="left65">I am, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">J.W. Croker.</p>

<p>To Vice-admiral Sir James Saumarez, Bart., KB.</p></div>

<p>To this highly honourable testimonial Sir James made the following
reply:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">London, 23rd November 1812.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have received your letter of the 20th inst., transmitting to me the
order to strike my flag and come on shore, and also communicating
their lordships' marked approbation of my conduct during my late
command, in terms highly gratifying to myself. I am also peculiarly
happy to find that the conduct I held towards the Northern Powers
during a period of the utmost intricacy, has been honoured by the
approbation of his Majesty's government, whilst it was duly
appreciated by the Courts of Sweden and Russia. I take this
opportunity to express my sincere acknowledgments for the unremitting
attention I received from you during the period of my late command.</p>

<p class="left65">I have, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">James Saumarez.</p>
<p>To J.W. Croker, Esq.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p></div>

<p>After Sir James had arrived in London he continued to direct the
proceedings of the fleet in the Baltic, and it was not until the good
work he had begun was completely ended to the general satisfaction that
he retired from actual service.</p>

<p class="p2"></p>

<p>The defeat of Buonaparte and the disastrous retreat of his army
released the countries which surround the Baltic from the oppression
to which they had been subject, and an English fleet was no longer
necessary in that sea. The enemy indeed had still possession of
Dantzig, and Denmark held out during the year 1813; but a small
squadron under Rear-admiral Sir George Hope acting now in conjunction
with Sweden, the co-operation of Russia was all that was wanted to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
carry on the blockade in the Belt, and to protect the commerce.</p>

<p>The services of a full admiral not being required, Sir James remained
at home, chiefly in his native island. The command in the
Mediterranean, which he would have had, had he not been requested to
continue on the command in the Baltic, was occupied by Sir Edward
Pellew, which, as will be hereafter seen, was an unfortunate
circumstance.</p>

<p>Although retired from active warfare, it cannot be said that Sir James
had retired from public life;&mdash;he was the patron of every useful
institution, not by mere nominal sanction, but also by very munificent
pecuniary contributions. He was one of the oldest members (I believe,
President) of the Society for promoting Christian Knowledge, having
become a subscriber to that institution in the year 1789; he was also
president of the Royal Naval Charitable Institution, and of the Naval
and Military Bible Society, as well as a large contributor. He was,
moreover, vice-president of the British and Foreign Bible Society, and
of the Society for promoting Christianity among the Jews; patron of
the National Schools of the Bethel Union; the Provident Society; the
Church of England Sunday School; the Church of England Missionary
Society, &amp;c. His mind and his time, therefore, were employed in a
manner no less honourable and useful than it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span> had been in his
Majesty's service; and it does not appear that he had taken any notice
of the manifest neglect of his claims until the peace of 1814, when,
at the conclusion of the war, peerages were conferred on those
officers of the army and navy who had most highly distinguished
themselves. He now found his name omitted; while Sir Edward Pellew, an
officer junior to him on the list of admirals, who had never commanded
a ship in a general action, and who was not even a Knight of the Bath,
was raised to the dignity of baron.</p>

<p>Sir James could not but consider this circumstance as an injustice to
his superior claims; and we know that Sir Edward Pellew, then created
Baron Exmouth, admitted that Sir James's claims for that high honour
were far greater than his own. We may add, that every officer of his
Majesty's navy was of the same opinion. Feeling himself bound to
remonstrate, a correspondence took place between Sir James and some of
his Majesty's ministers on the subject, but without effect; and we
believe that the only reason given by them for his having been passed
over, was simply "that Sir James's flag was not flying at the
conclusion of the war," while that of Sir E. Pellew was hoisted in the
Mediterranean, where indeed Sir James <i>ought</i> to have been, and where
he would certainly have been had he not accepted the command in the
Baltic at the request of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span> ministers, on the especial understanding
that it was not to be prejudicial to his claims. The fact was,
however, that he had <i>no friends</i> in power at that time; while Sir
Edward Pellew had many claims on ministers for the support he gave
them in Parliament.</p>

<p>It is needless to revert to the ungracious treatment he received,
which can only be accounted for by his having refused a seat in
Parliament, coupled with conditions to which his conscience would not
allow him to accede, and from his diffidence in not putting forward
his claims at an earlier period; too often the case with men who are
truly brave, but which is injurious to the service, inasmuch as it
induces a belief among the rising generation that even manifestly just
claims may be entirely neglected.</p>

<p>On the 4th of June 1814, when the general promotion took place, Sir
James was advanced to Admiral of the Blue, at which time his name on
the list of the navy was the fourth above Lord Exmouth.</p>

<p>The following is the extract of a letter from Sir James to one of the
family on the subject of the Peerage.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right smcap">London, 16th May 1814.</p>

<p>"You will have seen that a Peerage has been conferred on Sir Edward
Pellew; you may suppose that Sir John Duckworth and myself have taken
the proper means with Lord Melville for our services being taken into
consideration, for a similar mark of distinction, and there is every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
reason to believe we shall not be disregarded. I had a long interview
with Lord Melville, who gave me to understand that he laid the subject
as favourably as possible before Lord Liverpool. It is, I fear, very
doubtful, but I cannot persuade myself so much injustice will be done
to my services; and such is the opinion of all I meet."</p></div>

<p>Subsequently to this, Sir James received a letter from Lord Liverpool,
which need not be inserted, as the substance is given in Sir James's
answer, which we subjoin.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Date not exactly known, 1814.</p>
<p class="smcap">My Lord,</p>

<p>I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your lordship's letter
of this date, signifying that you have had an opportunity of
communicating to his Royal Highness the Prince Regent my request for
the honour of the Peerage, as well as some other applications for the
same honour from several distinguished officers of the navy and army,
and that your lordship was commanded by the Prince Regent to acquaint
me that his Royal Highness does full justice to my services on the
occasions to which I refer; but he feels it, nevertheless, quite
impossible, under all the circumstances, to comply with my request,
and that he has directed your lordship to return the same answer to
those who have made similar applications to him upon the present
occasion. Without presuming to inquire into the merits of those
distinguished officers with whom your lordship may have been pleased
to blend my services, your lordship will permit me to observe, that
the grounds upon which I found my application for the Peerage, were
not confined to my services during the whole period of the late and
American war; but also to my services during the five years that I had
the honour to command<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span> his Majesty's fleet upon the Baltic station
with the fullest approbation of Government, particularly for my
uniform conduct respecting Sweden, which prevented that nation from
joining the common enemy against this country, and also in having
detached a timely force to Riga under the order of Rear-admiral
Martin, which proved the means of preventing that city from falling
into the hands of the French, and also, through the exertions of that
zealous and able officer, succeeded in checking an important branch of
the enemy's army from penetrating towards St. Petersburg, for which
important services I have been honoured with the thanks of his
Imperial Majesty, communicated to me by his ambassador at this court.
As your lordship may not have laid those interesting particulars
regarding my services before the Prince Regent, I now most earnestly
request you will be pleased to render me that justice. I owe it to
myself, to my family, as well as to the naval service, to which I have
had the honour to belong upwards of forty-four years, to take the
proper means, with every due respect, that my long and most faithful
services are laid before his Royal Highness, in the fullest confidence
that they will be found deserving the same mark of distinction that
has been conferred upon an officer junior to me in the list of
admirals. I beg leave to express my unfeigned acknowledgments to your
lordship for the polite manner in which you have been pleased to
convey to me the sentiments of his Royal Highness.</p>

<p class="left45">I have the honour to be,<br />
<span class="i1">With the greatest respect,</span><br />
<span class="i2">My Lord</span><br />
<span class="i3">Your most obedient and humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right smcap">James Saumarez.</p>
<p>To the Right Hon. the Earl of Liverpool,<br />
<span class="i2">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c</span>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p></div>

<p>On Sir James's return to Guernsey, after his unsuccessful application to
ministers for a Peerage, he resumed the works of charity and benevolence
which had already done so much good to his native island. The ground on
which Sir James's church stands was his property; he made a free gift of
it to the building committee, and subscribed one thousand pounds towards
the construction of that place of public worship. He assisted in
improving the salaries of the masters and mistresses of the parochial
schools, and was principally instrumental in establishing the Sunday
school in the town parish. He founded an exhibition in Elizabeth
College, for the best classical and theological scholar. He gave three
hundred pounds in the Câtel parish, where his country seat was situate,
for the payment of a salary to the mistress of the girls' school. He
distributed at Christmas, every year, warm clothing to the poor of every
parish in the island, and, conjointly with the late dean, the Rev. Mr.
Durand, succeeded, after many fruitless attempts, in establishing a
national school at St. Peter Port. It has been justly said that he
considered the great wealth he possessed as "trust money," for which he
would have to account to that Being who had confided it to his care.</p>

<p>Sir James's residence being in Guernsey, where he possessed both a town
and country house, and considerable landed property, and where he found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
himself surrounded by the relations both of Lady Saumarez and himself,
he was induced to visit England but seldom. After the hundred days' war,
when the Continental Sovereigns came to London, he accompanied the
Prince Regent and his august allies to Oxford, and assisted in the
ceremonies observed on that memorable visit. Had hostilities continued,
there can be no doubt that he would have had the command of the Channel
fleet, and it is worthy of remark that he was told, on making
application for the Victory as his flag-ship, that four or five
admirals, who had sought employment, had applied also for that favourite
ship, notwithstanding the Howe, Nelson, and St. Vincent, new ships of
one hundred and twenty guns, were ready for commission. Sir James having
been second lieutenant of the <i>same</i> Victory forty-seven years before he
hoisted his flag in her, and being well aware of her excellent sailing
qualities, will account for his desire for that ship to bear his flag,
although it cannot be denied, that, having only one hundred guns, and
her metal reduced to eighteen pounders on the middle deck, she was much
inferior in force to those we have mentioned. The glorious victory of
Waterloo, however, put an end to all speculations on that subject; and
Sir James, having failed in an application for a similar reward to that
conferred on others for his meritorious services, retired again to his
native island.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span> After Sir James and Lord Nelson had returned from the
Mediterranean subsequently to the melancholy death of Captain Miller,
they met at Sir Peter Parker's at dinner, when Sir James proposed that a
subscription for a monument to Captain Miller's memory should be raised
among the Captains who fought with his lordship at the Nile. This
proposition was immediately adopted by Nelson, who volunteered to
promote it; and the following is a letter on the subject from Nelson to
Saumarez, which we insert here because it did not come to our hands
until after the first volume had been printed.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir James,</span>&mdash;I have written so fully
to Sir Edward Berry on the subject of dear Miller's monument, that I
can only repeat my words. Sir E. Berry thought that a plain monument
would cost only 200<i>l.</i> and be sufficient to mark our esteem, to which
I am ready to agree, provided we are to have the honour to ourselves.
I mean we, who fought with him on the 1st of August 1798; but if it is
judged better to admit those who fought with him on the 14th February
1797, then I think that a less sum than 500<i>l.</i> would be highly
improper for such a body to lay out on a monument. Flaxman is to be
the artist employed, and Mr. Davison, if he will take the trouble, the
manager of the whole business; for permission must be obtained from
the Chapter of St. Paul's, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>I wish we had all been off Brest when the squadron sailed; we might
have had the good fortune to have seen them. The San Josef appears to
answer very well; indeed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span> as far as we can judge at present, she is,
take her altogether, the finest three-decker in this country. I am
going, as you know, into the St. George, but I wish our Northern
matters could be accommodated; however, we must face all our enemies,
and, I trust, make them ashamed of themselves.</p>

<p>I know you have a lad of the name of Bate on board; if you wish to
part from him, I am bound to take him.</p>

<p>With my best compliments to Lady Saumarez, believe me ever, my dear
Sir James,</p>

<p class="left50">Your most obliged and affectionate,</p>
<p class="right smcap">Nelson and Bronte.</p>

<p>To Rear-admiral Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>Although this letter has no date, it is clear that it must have been
written just before the battle with the Danish fleet at Copenhagen in
1801; and it is evident that the merit of proposing a monument to the
brave Captain Miller is due to Sir James Saumarez.</p>

<p>He seldom ventured an opinion on political subjects: considering
himself a "friend to the King," it did not much concern him who his
Majesty's ministers were, and his refusal to support either side was
no detriment to his advancement during war, when his high character
and skill as a naval officer ensured him an important command; but
when peace came, and his services were no longer required, he was,
like many other meritorious officers, thrown completely on the shelf.
His son, the present lord, writes thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>Although Sir James was more than once offered a seat in Parliament, he
always steadily declined it, from the idea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span> that he could render
better service to his country by remaining free from politics; or if
ever the time did arrive when he might become a senator, he was
resolved that whichever house he entered he would be free and
unshackled.</p></div>

<p>On this subject Sir James writes a few lines to his brother when in
the temporary command of the Channel fleet:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>What you hint of a seat in Parliament has often occurred to me, but
hitherto I should have found it an encumbrance. At some future period
it may, perhaps, be more advisable; but you may rely on it that I
never wish to have one without maintaining my independence, and being
perfectly free and unbiassed by any party.</p></div>

<p>We are well assured that Sir James was decidedly against the Catholic
Emancipation, although after he obtained a peerage he voted for the
Reform Bill, being clearly of opinion that some reform of acknowledged
and flagrant abuses was necessary. He did not, however, intend to go
so far as many of his friends; he may be said to have nearly followed
the politics of Earl Grey, after the retirement of whom he took no
part in the affairs of the nation.</p>

<p>At every change which occurred in the Ministry, he sent a memorial of
his services and claims, but without effect; and it is well known that
he had a very unfruitful correspondence with the Duke of Wellington
and other cabinet ministers. It was at this period that he suffered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
another indignity in being passed over, when the Major-generalship of
Marines became vacant.</p>

<p>The following extracts from letters from Earl St. Vincent will show
his lordship's opinions on this subject. The first is to a friend.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Rochetts, 8th May 1821.</p>

<p>I feel very much for Sir James Saumarez. I have lost no opportunity of
stating his high pretensions, which in my judgment are very far
superior to any other upon the list of flag-officers. When I gain a
little more strength I shall be glad to see him.</p></div>

<p>The second is to Sir James,</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I cannot too highly appreciate
the interest you take in a late event, and happy shall I be to greet
you upon the reward due to your exalted and unrivalled services, a
manifestation of which has on no occasion been let slip by your old
and sincere friend,</p>
<p class="right smcap">St. Vincent.</p></div>

<p>On the 4th of April 1824, Sir James, then Admiral of the White,
hoisted his flag on board the Britannia as Port Admiral at Plymouth.
It was during his period of command that Earl Grey, who was fully
sensible of the unhandsome and ungrateful manner in which he had been
treated, visited Plymouth, and when his health was proposed by Sir
James at the Royal Naval Club openly announced his sentiments in the
following words:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>I rise to offer my best thanks for the manner in which the president
(Sir James Saumarez) has been pleased to propose my health, and for
the assent which the gentlemen present have given to the gallant
Admiral's favourable view of me as a public character. I cannot but
remind those about me of the merits of my noble friend&mdash;[then
correcting himself, Earl Grey went on]&mdash;I wish I could call him
my <i>noble</i> friend (<i>noble</i>, I mean, in rank, as he is already <i>noble</i>
in mind)&mdash;I wish I could see him ennobled by his Sovereign, as
his services entitle him to be; for who would deny him that honour,
who recollects the career which he has run from Rodney's glorious day,
the battles off Cape St. Vincent and the Nile, down to his own
brilliant exploits in the Crescent and as commander-in-chief at
Algeziras, and not say, that if ever a name should or would have
graced the peerage, it should have been that of Saumarez?
</p></div>

<p>Ralfe, in his Naval Biography, after alluding to the above speech,
justly remarks,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>Were it a matter of importance to adduce further proof of the high
opinion entertained of Sir James's abilities, we believe we might name
nearly the whole list of Admirals; for we never yet conversed with a
single officer who was not loud in his praise, and who did not think
the service neglected in his person.</p></div>

<p>At Plymouth, Sir James received a visit from Lord Exmouth, with whom
he had had no personal communication since the time when they both
commanded frigates on the Plymouth station.</p>

<p>Sir James struck his flag for the last time on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span> the 10th of May 1827,
after a most glorious career of nearly sixty years. His reiterated
claims were still disregarded.</p>

<p>We have now arrived at the period when the great revolution in the
affairs of the state brought Earl Grey into power, previously to
which, his late Majesty William IV. had ascended the throne; and one
of the first and most popular acts of the "Sailor King," who well knew
the merits of Sir James, was to wipe off that slur on the national
gratitude, by raising him to the peerage.</p>

<p>Sir James having arrived in London, had communication with Sir James
Graham, then first Lord of the Admiralty, after which he wrote as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">London, 9th September 1831.</p>

<p>This morning, I had a long interview with Sir James Graham, who, I
must say, is most favourably inclined towards me, and assures me that
Earl Grey, with whom he has had frequent conversations, is equally so.
I have an appointment with the latter to-morrow, but I do not
anticipate any favourable result, and can only say, "God's will be
done."</p></div>

<p>We need scarcely add, that his application was successful; Sir James
was raised to the long-expected and well-merited dignity of a Baron on
the first of October 1831. The following extract of a letter from Lady
Saumarez to her son,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span> describing the arrival of the first
intelligence, we are sure will be perused with interest.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Saumarez, 4th October 1831.</p>

<p>I also remember, my dear James, that October is an eventful month to
us all; that to-morrow is your wedding day, and Sunday is your
birth-day,&mdash;and you may be sure we shall not fail to keep them
both in remembrance, in our prayers and warmest wishes, that they may
ever be numbered among those marked <i>blessed</i>. Our register has now to
unroll a brilliant page, which, I trust, the same divine hand that
inscribed it, will seal with that <i>stamp</i>.</p>

<p>Wonderful it is yet to me&mdash;so suddenly, so unexpectedly, did it
come at last! I admit there is no excuse for my incredulity, except
that of thinking your dear father had been so strangely deprived of
his well-earned reward through the injustice of <i>man</i> on so many
occasions, <i>because</i>, far better things than <i>man</i> could give were in
store for him. And although I did not doubt, if any naval Peers were
created at the coronation, he would be one, I did not allow my
thoughts to dwell upon it; and when the Gazette arrived without his
name, I gave it up altogether. You may therefore judge my surprise on
Wednesday morning, when a tap at my door announced Betty Williams,
who, in breathless agitation, came to my bedside to say, Mr. C.
Lefebvre was below, to inform me "Sir James was made a lord!"</p>

<p>When I joined him at breakfast, an hour after, he gave me so many
interesting particulars which he had heard, that the account could not
be disbelieved; but the entrance of two letters removed every shadow
of doubt. The accounts from England of the reception of this event
everywhere, from all classes and parties, have no parallel;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span> and it
seems to me as if the dignity had been deferred to prepare it for
greater glory and additional lustre. We must indeed, as you say, be
more than mortals if we could be unmoved at such things; they are so
great that we have need to pray for a humble spirit to keep us from
being "exalted above measure,"&mdash;and to make us remember that this
donation is an additional "talent," which we are bound to use by our
influence and example, in the cause of "whatever is holy, just, and of
good report."</p></div>

<p>When the intelligence was known to the inhabitants of Guernsey, that
the Admiral had been raised to the peerage, by the title of "Baron de
Saumarez of Guernsey," all classes of the community fully manifested
the pleasure they enjoyed at this signal honour; he being the first
native of that island who had taken his seat in the House of Lords. On
the 6th October, 1831, the bailiff officially announced the joyful
news in his Billet d'Etat, in the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="smcap">Lord de Saumarez.</p>

<p>The elevation of one of our citizens to one of the highest dignities
of the kingdom, cannot fail to inspire us with the most lively
gratification. His Majesty has rewarded, with the most distinguished
honour, the eminent services which he has rendered to the country.
Guernsey, which, besides the public man, recognises in him all the
virtues which adorn a private station, ought, on this happy occasion,
to testify how sincerely she honours his character. To mark our
esteem, the authorities of the Bailiwick, at the head of the whole
population, ought to crowd around<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span> him at his return and proffer their
congratulations. I should fail in my duty to the States, were I to
neglect affording them this opportunity.</p></div>

<p>In reply to this address, the States unanimously agreed to meet at the
court-house on the day after the arrival of Lord de Saumarez, at
eleven o'clock in the morning, and thence to repair to the residence
of their noble fellow-citizen, and felicitate him on his elevation to
the peerage.</p>

<p>Lord de Saumarez, after a tedious and stormy passage across the
channel, arrived at Guernsey late in the evening of Tuesday, the 25th
of October; but, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour, the pier
was crowded with people, who cheered him as he landed, and who
attended him with every demonstration of joy to the carriage which was
in waiting for him; and it was with much difficulty the people could
be prevented taking out the horses. He was very much fatigued, having
embarked at Southampton on Friday evening in the packet. On Saturday
morning, when in sight of Alderney, a gale overtook the vessel, and
the captain was obliged to bear up for Weymouth roads, where he
remained till Monday; but his lordship had not recovered the effects
of the storm: a night's rest, however, completely restored him.</p>

<p>On the following morning (26th October) the States assembled at the
court-house, and as soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span> as the names of the members were called
over, the bailiff read the address, which he had prepared, and which
was unanimously agreed to. And, after having ascertained that his
lordship was ready to receive them, the States proceeded to his
residence, where the address was delivered to him, surrounded by Lady
de Saumarez and the members of his family then in the island.</p>

<p class="p2"></p>

<p>After Sir James's elevation to the peerage, he came during the session
from his residence in Guernsey to London, in order to attend his duty
in Parliament, but did not join any party in politics. We have already
said that he voted for the Reform Bill, being fully convinced that
some reform was necessary; but we know that he was firmly attached to
the Constitution and to the Established Church, and he may be said to
have followed nearest to the opinions of Earl Grey, after whose
retirement from office he did not appear in Parliament.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span> When the
Author paid his lordship a visit at Tunbridge Wells in the winter of
1833, he found him much altered, and it was but too evident that his
constitution was broken. In the summer of 1834 he had to deplore the
loss of his second son (Thomas), who died on the 4th of July, on which
mournful occasion he wrote the following letter to his son.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>In the heavy affliction with which it has pleased the Almighty to
visit us, he has not left us without consolation; and our confidence
in the Divine mercy, and the hope that your beloved brother is removed
to a better world, in the enjoyment of the blessed, through the
precious merits of our dear Redeemer, must tend to assuage our sorrow,
and induce us to submit with due resignation to the divine will. It
will be to me a source of the greatest consolation, as it must be to
us all, my dear James, to have witnessed his meek and patient
resignation during his severe illness. It has been to me, as yourself
and your dear Mary will readily believe, a most distressing and truly
painful trial; but it has pleased God to support me through the whole
of this sorrowful time far beyond what I could ever have thought
myself to have been equal to, and I trust that your dear mother and
beloved brother and sister will continue resigned to the will of
Providence.</p></div>

<p>Lord de Saumarez's amiable disposition afforded him support under
severe and unexpected losses of every description, of which the
following anecdote is a proof. In the spring of 1834 he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span> met with a
loss on his journey to visit Sir John Orde at Beckingham, which we
will venture to say would have been borne in a very different way by
many of his brother officers. His own carriage being under repair, he
had borrowed one from the coachmaker, which could only take one trunk
behind; in this trunk the female servant, who had lived a long time in
the family, had deposited his valuable diamond star of the Order of
the Bath, together with some costly jewels and trinkets belonging to
Lady de Saumarez and her daughter. On their arrival at Sir John's
mansion at Beckingham, it was discovered, to their utter
consternation, that the trunk had been cut off by thieves and carried
away with its contents, the value of which amounted to near 1000<i>l.</i>
Sir James bore the loss with the most philosophic coolness; for,
instead of finding fault with the servant for placing such valuable
articles in so hazardous a situation, with his true habitual kindness,
he used his utmost endeavours to soothe the distress she felt as
having been the unintentional cause of the loss. Information was
immediately given at the Police-office, but none of the property was
ever heard of, excepting the trunk, which was found empty in a field
by the road side.</p>

<p>In Sweden the name of Saumarez will be for ever spoken of with
gratitude and respect, and all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span> strangers who visit that country are
sure in their memoirs to mention the services which he had rendered.
In Mr. Lloyd's book we find:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>To the good understanding which existed between Count Rosen and Sir
James Saumarez, our admiral on that station, may be ascribed the
flourishing trade which was afterwards carried on during a period of
nominal war, and the re-establishment of peace between the countries
which soon after followed. Of Sir James Saumarez the inhabitants still
speak in the highest terms of respect and regard, for his mildness and
moderation in command, and for the attention he invariably paid to
their numerous applications and wants.</p></div>

<p>A tourist in Sweden writes as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Stockholm, 22nd Jan. 1832.</p>

<p>To-day I shall again have the honour of dining with Count Wetterstedt.
Many, many inquiries were made after the health and happiness of the
gallant and amiable Lord de Saumarez, whose name is beloved and
respected throughout the whole kingdom. I landed at Christiania and
travelled by land within fifty miles of Stockholm, and even the
peasantry are familiar with my Patron's excellent name and character,
the great friend of Sweden.</p></div>

<p>In October 1834, Lord de Saumarez received the last mark of Royal
favour from the King of Sweden, who sent him a splendid full-length
portrait of himself, which was forwarded with the following letter
from the late highly respected Count Wetterstedt, then Minister for
Foreign Affairs at Stockholm:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Stockholm, le 7 d'Octobre 1834.</p>
<p class="smcap">Milord,</p>

<p>Depuis longtems le Roi mon auguste Souverain vous avait destiné,
Milord, son portrait en pied comme un témoignage de son estime des
services signalés que vous avez rendus à la Suede dans les années
1810-12.</p>

<p>Divers incidens en avaient retardé l'expédition, d'autant plus
regrettables au Roi, que sa Majesté avait appris l'intérêt que vous
aviez attaché à ce souvenir de sa part. L'occasion opportune qui se
présente maintenant de pouvoir embarquer ce portrait à bord du
bâtiment à vapeur, le Lightning, de la Marine Britannique, qui
transporte ici Monsieur de Disbrowe, a été saisie par le Roi, et j'ai
l'honneur de vous annoncer en son nom que cette expédition vient
d'être effectuée.</p>

<p>En faisant placer sur ce portrait cette inscription, "Charles XIV.
Jean, à James Lord Saumarez, au nom du Peuple Suédois," sa Majesté
s'est plue à transmettre à la posterité une preuve éclatante des
souvenirs qui restent chez elle, et chez la Nation qu'elle gouverne,
des vues éclairées du Gouvernement Britannique à une époque à jamais
mémorable, et de la noble loyauté que vous mites, Milord, dans leur
accomplissement.</p>

<p>Il m'est d'autant plus agréable, Milord, d'être auprès de vous
l'organe de ces sentimens de mon Souverain, que je trouve une occasion
d'y ajouter ceux de la haute considération avec laquelle j'ai
l'honneur d'être,</p>

<p class="left50">Milord,<br />
<span class="i1">Votre très humble et très obéissant Serviteur,</span></p>
<p class="right smcap">Le Cte. de Wetterstedt.</p></div>

<p>This portrait, which is the natural size of the illustrious donor,
arrived safely at Guernsey, where the Author saw it, and can affirm
that it is an excellent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span> likeness of his Majesty, who was always
grateful for the services which Lord de Saumarez had rendered to his
adopted country. Not less so were the merchants in London, who were
preparing a splendid piece of plate, which the noble admiral did not
live to receive, but which was presented to his son, the present lord.</p>

<p>We now approach the last days of this great and good man. He had yet
another contest to encounter, and he entered upon it with that same
moral courage, which, being founded on his trust in the Almighty, had
hitherto enabled him to overcome every difficulty, and to face every
danger; he had yet another victory to achieve, in which he came off
more than conqueror. We are now to behold him as no longer holding
intercourse with earth, but rather standing on the confines of either
world; not indeed as preparing to meet his God, for that had been the
business of his whole life, but as ready to obey whenever his summons
came.</p>

<p>With the exceptions of occasional attacks of gout, which in general
were more tedious than severe, he may be considered to have enjoyed a
good state of health; but for the last three years his friends
perceived that advanced age was gradually bringing on its debilitating
effects. He was no longer able to walk with that firm commanding step,
and that erect posture of body for which he had always been noted; but
his mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span> retained its usual energy, and when he fell in with any of
his old companions he would converse on the deeds of his more active
life with all the vigour and animation of youth. Notwithstanding he
had nearly attained the latest of those periods assigned by the
Psalmist as the general boundary of human life, his children had still
fondly hoped that he might yet have been spared a few years; neither
had she, who for forty-eight years had been the joy and solace of his
existence, and who had watched over him with the most sincere and
devoted affection, any particular reason to think that they were so
soon to be severed. A few weeks before his death, his increasing
debility; attended with loss of appetite and inability of retaining
food, excited some slight apprehensions, which, though not sufficient
to cause alarm on the first appearance of those symptoms, led, as they
increased, to the conviction that the system was decaying.</p>

<p>On the 30th of September Lord de Saumarez seemed to have recovered his
usual good looks, and appeared with the cheerfulness which, when in
health, he always assumed. That day he received several friends, who
congratulated him on his convalescence; but the members of his family
who watched him most attentively, observed that he received their
congratulations with distrust, as if conscious of his declining state;
and, on their departure, calling one of them aside, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span> emphatically
told him, that his looks were not to be depended on, for that he
really felt ill. It is even said that he had already given directions
to his confidential servants respecting some of the last duties. On
the morrow his increased debility showed that his opinion of his own
state was but too correct, and on the next day, which was Sunday, he
awoke, after an uneasy night, under the pressure of distressing
symptoms. Finding it was too late for his family to go to church, he
requested they would read the service to him, and was afterwards much
employed in meditation. It was now apparent that he was impressed with
the belief, that the time of his departure was at hand, for he seemed
as if taking a farewell of terrestrial objects and resigning his soul
to his Maker and Redeemer.</p>

<p>More than once he exclaimed, "I am the resurrection and the life,
saith the Lord; he that believeth in me, though he were dead yet shall
he live, and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die."
"What comfort, <i>shall never die</i>," he repeated, in a manner which
showed the hope he himself entertained of a blessed immortality. He
was well acquainted with every page of the sacred writings, the
perusal of a portion of which, including the psalms of the day, had
for many years formed part of his regular employment, and it was now
he felt the comfort which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span> they inspired and the support which they
afforded under the near prospect of death and the grave.</p>

<p>Monday brought no amendment; it was evident that nature was sinking,
and his medical attendants no longer concealed their apprehensions of
the result. Those of his family, who had the privilege of attending
him at this solemn period, while they were filled with sorrow at the
prospect of losing one so deservedly dear to them, could not
contemplate the calmness and composure with which he met the
approaching change, without feelings of the most devout admiration.</p>

<p>Still seeking comfort from its only true source, Heavenly themes were
the prevailing occupation of his thoughts. "The Lord," he said, "is my
light and my salvation; of whom then shall I be afraid?" He also
repeated from memory the 23rd and 34th Psalms, together with some
other parts of the holy volume. On the Thursday, which may be
considered as the last day on which he enjoyed the full power of
speech and consciousness, his tongue was still employed in magnifying
the God of his salvation: several times he repeated, "If God is for
us, who can be against us?" sometimes adding, "Who shall lay anything
to the charge of God's elect?" Once he said, "Oh, my poor mind!"&mdash;"Not
a poor mind," was the reply, "but a rich one, stored as it is with
such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span> heavenly things:" when he meekly answered, "I have tried to make
it so."</p>

<p>The two following days he felt increased difficulty in breathing, and
though only able to give occasional utterance to his thoughts, the
constant joining of his hands, and the devotion of his countenance,
showed that his understanding was still able to unite in the
supplications which his family offered up in behalf of the dying
husband and parent. His recollection, however, was gradually leaving
him; for, on Lady de Saumarez approaching his bedside on the morning
of Saturday, he no longer recognised her; he appeared to be fast
passing from this world to better and everlasting habitations. It was,
as this excellent and truly Christian woman acknowledged, more than
mortal strength which enabled her to contemplate without a murmur the
separation that was so soon to take place, and which raised her mind
above the distressing scene before her, to find utterance in prayer
for herself and for the departing spirit of her husband. She was not
sensible that she was heard, till, a few moments after she had
concluded, he distinctly said, in the metrical version of the 122nd
psalm, "It was a joyful sound to hear." It is uncertain whether this
alluded to the words of the prayer just uttered, or whether the
Almighty was already pleased to vouchsafe to him, as there is reason
to believe he does to his faithful servants when approaching the great
conflict, some assurance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span> of his salvation, by admitting him to a
distant sound of the Hallelujahs of those blessed spirits which
surround the throne. From whatever source sprung this sentence, dear
and precious must it ever be to those who loved him; for these were
the last words he distinctly pronounced,&mdash;the last sound of his voice
in this world!</p>

<p>The next day (Sunday) was the 9th of October, a day which had been one
of peculiar interest to him, being the birth-day of his eldest son,
who was unfortunately prevented by a weak state of health, attended
with bodily infirmity, which would not admit of his crossing the water
in the stormy weather then prevailing, from being present at the dying
bed of his beloved parent.</p>

<p>His breathing now became very laborious, but his lordship was
apparently at ease and free from pain. Sometimes it was thought a
degree of consciousness existed; for when at noon his second son, who
had just arrived from England, appeared in the apartment and spoke, a
slight movement of the body was perceptible. Towards night the pulse
rapidly declined, the breathing, which had been much relieved during
the day, became gradually fainter, every limb was at rest, the whole
body in repose, as if indicating the happy state of that spirit which
was about to be resigned into the hands of Him that gave it.</p>

<p>A few minutes before midnight, the wise Disposer of all things was
pleased to close the mortal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span> scene; the cessation of the act of
breathing was the only sign of dissolution; and even at that moment
his countenance bore an expression no language can portray; unimpaired
by illness, or the course of nearly fourscore years, time seemed to
have restored to his features and complexion the freshness and bloom
of the prime of life. In beholding such a blissful termination of
mortal existence, we have here a happy illustration of the words of
the prophet, "The work of righteousness shall be peace, and the effect
of righteousness quietness, and assurance for ever."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>In order to form a correct estimate of the merits of the late Lord de
Saumarez, his character should be viewed under the opposite relations
of life&mdash;professional and domestic; and very few who have belonged to
the navy, or indeed any service, have been more distinguished in
either. Rear-Admiral Sir Jahleel Brenton, Bart. &amp;c. now Lieutenant
Governor of the Royal Hospital at Greenwich, has given us the
following sketch of his professional character, of which he must be
admitted to be the best judge, having served several years as his
captain under the most trying circumstances of his life.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>I had frequent opportunities of observing him in both characters, and
knew not which to admire most&mdash;that perfect enjoyment which he
seemed to possess in the bosom of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span> his family; that peculiar faculty
of giving and receiving happiness in the truly happy circle of which
he was the centre&mdash;or that energy of character which led him with
enthusiasm into active service, and which made the good of his country
paramount to every other consideration. Perhaps the most weary of all
situations, to a naval officer, is, when placed in command of a
squadron, watching an enemy's fleet, particularly on such a station as
that of Brest; and there my noble friend was severely tried, first, as
a captain with a squadron under his orders, and afterwards as a flag
officer. The rapidity of the tides, as well as their irregularity, and
the constant heavy gales from the westward, render the service a most
anxious one; and he indeed felt the full force of the responsibility;
but the determined resolution with which he maintained his position,
under the most threatening circumstances, gave the fullest assurance
to the commander-in-chief, that this most important post was in able
and sure hands. All his officers and crew had their regular portions
of repose; but sleep to the officer charged with this immense
responsibility was almost impossible during the night, and a few
transient snatches of rest through the day, when danger could be seen
or avoided, were all that could be obtained, and these enabled him to
sustain the fatigue to which he was exposed.</p>

<p>During the long winter nights, we could all observe the effects of
this most trying situation upon the Admiral's appearance, who, having
alone the responsibility for the safety of all the ships under his
command, suffered in proportion to its amount. It was, at the same
time, a subject of general remark, how every trace of fatigue and
anxiety instantly vanished on the arrival of a letter from his family.
It would have been natural to suppose that, deeply as he felt the
happiness of home, so in proportion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span> would have been his distaste for
a service that deprived him of it; but the moment that he was assured
of the welfare of the objects of his affectionate solicitude, his
countenance was lighted up by the utmost gratitude to the Giver of all
blessings, and he again devoted himself to the fulfilment of his
arduous duties with renewed energy.</p>

<p>It was frequently said by Earl St. Vincent, that when an officer of
the navy married, he lost much of his value in his profession. There
are, doubtless, many exceptions to that rule, and Sir James Saumarez
was a most striking one; for I believe he was most powerfully
stimulated to great and good actions, by the consideration of the
share those dear to him would enjoy in their results. And, certainly,
no energy whatever was wanting to get his ship, or squadron, ready for
sea, or to proceed with the utmost despatch in the execution of his
orders, however it might curtail the period of his domestic
enjoyments; everything gave way to duty, and every possible degree of
energy and zeal was brought into action for the execution of it.</p>

<p>The lively sensibility, which formed so prominent a feature in the
character of our lamented hero, was most remarkable. It was not only
in the intercourse of private friendship and in acts of kindness and
benevolence, that this feeling was evinced; but upon all occasions,
public as well as private, he manifested how deeply his heart was
engaged in events which might bear on the interests of his friends and
his country. I well remember, when off the Black Rocks in April 1801,
his coming on board, from a visit he paid to the commander-in-chief,
and bringing a newspaper, containing an account of the landing in
Egypt, and the attack on the Danish fleet at Copenhagen by Lord
Nelson. He directed me to cause the hands to be turned up; but when
they were assembled, his feelings had so completely overcome him, that
he found it utterly impossible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span> to read the account. Many instances of
this peculiar depth of feeling and goodness of heart might be
enumerated. I shall only add, that he was most exemplary in his
conduct, and most exact in causing all the offices of religion to be
performed on board his ship, allowing nothing short of the most
imperative duties of the ship to interrupt divine service!</p></div>

<p>In conclusion, we must seriously recommend to our young readers, and
particularly to those of the Royal Navy, to whom indeed the whole
memoir is addressed, to read with attention the following remarks on
the moral and religious character of the late illustrious and noble
Admiral.</p>

<p>His lordship was a sincere Christian, in the most exalted sense of the
word; his religion was a strong principle, pervading every decision
and action of his long and distinguished life. It was a principle
emanating from a sound knowledge and love of scripture truth; those
who were honoured with his confidence, and who saw him at all times,
and under different circumstances, particularly in the hour of
sickness and in affliction, can testify with what earnestness he
turned to the great source of strength and consolation, with what
warmth of feeling he spoke of the redeeming mercies of God in Christ
Jesus; it was a theme to which he delighted to give utterance, and in
a way which convinced those who heard him, that it constituted the
firm, prevailing, comforting belief and support of his own mind and
heart.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span> A friend, who visited Lord de Saumarez during a severe
illness, was deeply affected on hearing him say, that he had passed a
sleepless night, not so much from the bodily sufferings he endured as
from the painful reflection of the misery and danger of the multitudes
who were living without God in the world, particularly those who were
opposed to the gospel of Christ, and that he had earnestly prayed to
God on their behalf. It was a similar feeling which led him to employ
himself with so much zeal, and such magnificent liberality for the
erection of St. James's church in his native island: it owes its
existence mainly to him. No sacrifice appeared too great to ensure the
success of an undertaking which provided four hundred free sittings
for the use of the poor population. More recently, in the same spirit,
he became a bountiful contributor to another church, in a populous
district of the island; and his last public act was laying the
foundation-stone of that edifice. The multitudes who there saw his
benign countenance, will not quickly forget the devotion which mingled
with the performance of the ceremony. He ever liberally supported the
schools and religious institutions; but indeed his charity was
unbounded. In every case of public emergency, or of private distress,
he was a sure refuge; and the hopes entertained of his assistance and
sympathy were never disappointed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span> The success which attended his
Lordship in his profession, has proved that moral and religious worth,
far from unfitting men for the naval service, only qualifies them the
more for the right discharge of their arduous duties. No commander
ever possessed in a higher degree the confidence of the navy, the
respect of the community at large, and the love and veneration of
friends and relatives; and surely it is not too much to add, that this
homage was paid, not more to his professional skill and valour, not
more to the eminent services he had rendered to his king and country,
than to the Christian excellency which ever adorned his life and
actions.</p>

<h4>BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR OF LIEUT. GENERAL SIR THOMAS SAUMAREZ.</h4>
<p class="p2"></p>
<div class="font95">
<p>In adding the following memoir of this distinguished officer, who is a
younger brother of the late noble Lord, we feel confident that it will
be read with interest, his services having been in some degree mixed
up with those of his illustrious brother, in the prosecution of the
American and the late Continental war. The author having been
intimately acquainted with Sir Thomas, and having for many years kept
up a constant correspondence with him, has peculiar satisfaction in
discharging this duty of gratitude to a friend for whom he had always
the highest regard and respect, and to whom he materially owes his
advancement in the profession to which he has the honour to belong.</p>

<p>Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Saumarez entered the army in January 1776,
at the early age of 15 years, when he purchased a second lieutenancy in
the 23rd regiment or Royal Welsh Fusiliers. He was at the taking of New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
York Island, and assisted at the storming of Fort Washington and in
capturing 3300 men.</p>

<p>In April 1777, he embarked on board transports with the regiment, and
proceeded to destroy all the military stores and provisions the enemy
had collected at Danburg in the province of Connecticut. He first
distinguished himself in the action fought at this place, and in the
actions of Ridgefield and Compo Point. Having obtained a lieutenancy in
1778 without purchase at Philadelphia, he soon after was selected to
serve in the company of grenadiers which was then attached to the
brigade, composed of more than fifty companies of grenadiers. He was in
the severe action fought at Monmouth, in the Jerseys, when the captain,
and more than one-third of the company to which he belonged, were killed
or wounded. His services were volunteered with the regiment to serve as
marines on board Lord Howe's fleet, destined to attack the French fleet,
under Count D'Estaing, at Rhode Island, very superior in size and weight
of metal to the British: a dreadful storm arose when the two fleets were
within gun-shot of each other, which prevented the engagement. In 1779,
he embarked and went up Hudson's River to East Chester, and Ver Plank's
Point, and was at the attack of Fort La Fayette and other fortified
places, which surrendered.</p>

<p>On the return of young Saumarez to New York in September 1779, he was
strongly recommended by his commanding officer to General Clinton, the
commander-in-chief, and, in consequence, was permitted to purchase a
company in the Royal Welsh Fusiliers, although he was only 19 years of
age. The day following, he embarked with several regiments, under the
command of Earl Cornwallis, with the intention of attacking several
French West Indian Islands. A few days after leaving New York, a frigate
hove in sight, the captain of which gave information to Vice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span> Admiral
Arbuthnot, that two days before he had seen a large fleet of men-of-war,
under the command of Count De Grasse, very superior in numbers to our
convoy, and that he supposed the enemy to be within a day's sail of our
ships. Upon this the Admiral made the signal for all the transports to
return as expeditiously as possible to New York, where he disembarked.</p>

<p>In December, our young officer embarked with many regiments, under the
command of Lieutenant General Clinton, and sailed for South Carolina, to
besiege the city of Charlestown, which surrendered on the 12th of May
1780. Soon after this, he was detached with 4000 men, under the orders
of Earl Cornwallis, and after marching upwards of one hundred miles took
possession of Camden. At this place, our little army became so sickly
that we had more than 1100 men in the hospital, which, with many
detachments, reduced our number to less than 2000 effective men. The
enemy being apprised of this, was induced to collect a force of more
than 7000 men, with the intention of attacking and capturing our little
army, under the command of General Gates. On the 15th of August, Lord
Cornwallis was informed that the Americans were within twelve miles of
Camden, and consisted of six to one in numbers more than we had to
oppose to them. Upon this, his lordship considered it was too late to
think of retreating to Charlestown, and not wishing to abandon our sick
in hospital, decided at once that, by attacking the enemy, we had a
great deal to gain and little to lose. He accordingly issued an order to
march at nine o'clock the same evening. About two hours after, the
advance guards of the British and of the Americans encountered each
other, as the enemy had begun to march precisely at the same hour: after
skirmishing some time, the firing ceased, and both armies waited most
impatiently for the dawn of day of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span> the 16th, when they formed, and
immediately engaged; the Americans at the same time detaching troops on
both the flanks of the British, to prevent their escaping, under the
expectation of taking the whole prisoners. On the other hand, the
British marched coolly to meet the enemy, although under a very heavy
fire of cannon and musketry, until they came within twenty yards of
their opponents. Here Lord Cornwallis took off his hat, which was a
signal for the line to give three hearty cheers, advance, and, when
within a few yards of the enemy, fire a well-directed volley and charge:
this was done with such effect that the first line of the Americans ran
away and overset their reserve; the result was, that the British killed
(mostly with the bayonet), wounded, and took prisoners 300 more than
they had men in the field, took seven pieces of brass cannon, 150
waggons, full of all sorts of military stores, camp equipage, &amp;c.</p>

<p>About three weeks after this action, Lord Cornwallis, upon finding the
greater number of the sick had left the hospital, issued an order for
all the officers' baggage which could possibly be dispensed with to be
destroyed immediately, as the little army was going by forced marches in
pursuit of the enemy. The troops accordingly marched seventeen
successive days, from five o'clock in the evening to eight or nine the
following morning, oftentimes with a very scanty allowance, or no
provisions, as it was through an exhausted country, without bread, (as
the corn mills had been rendered unserviceable,) except some Indian corn
used by the cattle, and this corn was taken from the fields. The troops
were without tents or any covering to shelter them from the intense heat
and heavy rains peculiar to the climate. They had to ford frequently
four or five rivers and creeks in a day; some of these were deeper than
their waist, and so rapid, that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span> officers and soldiers found it
requisite to tie and support each other. Under these circumstances the
men were frequently exposed to a most galling fire from the enemy,
strongly posted: if a man was wounded, he was let go down the stream and
drowned.</p>

<p>During a march of 1500 miles through South and North Carolina and
Virginia, the officers and soldiers were subjected to the greatest
sufferings, privations, and hardships, which, (as Lord Cornwallis
frequently observed in his despatches,) could not be possibly exceeded,
their clothes being worn out, especially their boots and shoes. They
were, moreover, almost without wine or spirits, having destroyed the
greater part when orders were issued at Camden to lessen the baggage as
much as possible, which deprived the officers of the comforts they so
much required, and which they had obtained with the greatest trouble and
expense: for this sacrifice, they never received the smallest
recompence. The officers having the rank of captain were allowed to ride
on a march, but in consequence of a requisition made to Lord Cornwallis
by Colonel Tarleton, commanding the cavalry, not only for the riding
horses, but also for all the cart horses, which were most serviceable to
mount his troopers, his lordship most reluctantly compelled every
officer to deliver the best of the horses for the cavalry. The captains
naturally lent their horses to the officers and men who might require
them from illness or otherwise; it was soon found out that they could
not be dispensed with, so that cast-off horses were substituted for
those they had been obliged to give up.</p>

<p>The little army being nearly exhausted with fatigue, the officers and
men became most anxious that, instead of the minor actions and
skirmishes to which they were frequently exposed, the enemy would
collect all his force<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span> and give them an opportunity to fight and end
their labours.</p>

<p>On the 14th of March 1781, Lord Cornwallis received intelligence that
General Green, with a force five times greater as to numbers than the
British, was within ten miles. His lordship determined to attack them
the day following, and put his little corps in motion at daybreak of the
15th of March. About noon, he fell in with the enemy most advantageously
posted, and formed in three lines; the first, which was behind rails,
kept up a most incessant fire, from four six-pounders and musquetry,
upon the British troops as they advanced upon a ploughed field, which
was very muddy from rain that fell the day before. Notwithstanding all
these disadvantages, they marched coolly to the Americans without firing
a musket until within a few yards, when they halted to fire a
well-directed volley and charged. Upon this, they had to encounter the
enemy's second and third lines, which were attacked in the same manner
and totally dispersed, leaving their four six-pounders, the only guns
they had, in the field, which were bravely taken by the brigade of
guards: these four six-pounders were soon after retaken by a charge from
Colonel Washington's cavalry, and two of these guns were ultimately
taken by Captain Saumarez, who had the command of the left wing of the
regiment from the commencement of the action, after Captain Pater, who
commanded the royal Welsh Fusiliers, was wounded in the early part of
the engagement, and the left wing had been separated from the right wing
when in pursuit of the first line of the Americans. The other two
six-pounders were also taken by Colonel Tarleton's cavalry: these four
guns were all the Americans brought into the field.</p>

<p>The enemy's loss in killed and wounded was very considerable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span> The Welsh
Fusiliers and most of the other corps of Lord Cornwallis's army had
about one third of the officers and soldiers in the field killed and
wounded, and most unhappily, during the action, the lighted paper of the
cartridges set fire to the dried leaves, so that many of the unfortunate
wounded, which could not be removed, belonging to the British and
Americans, were burnt to death. Earl Cornwallis mentioned in his
despatches, "that the conduct and actions of the officers and soldiers
that compose this little army, will do more justice to their merit than
I can by words. Their persevering intrepidity in action, their
invincible patience in the hardships and fatigues of a march of many
hundred miles, in which they have forded several large rivers and
numberless creeks, many of which would be reckoned large rivers in any
other country in the world, without tents or covering against the
climate, and often without provisions, will sufficiently manifest their
ardent zeal for the honour and interests of their sovereign and their
country."</p>

<p>This engagement was generally considered to be the hottest and
bloodiest, as well as the best fought throughout the war.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The army
marched from Guildford the 18th of March for Wilmington, where it
arrived the 7th of April. At this place the officers and soldiers
fortunately were enabled to supply themselves with a small quantity of
wine and spirits, with which they had been without for some months, also
with tea and sugar and some clothing, of which they began to be in the
greatest need, in consequence of having been compelled to destroy the
greatest part of their baggage twice for the good of the service, since
they arrived at Camden in June 1780.</p>

<p>On the 25th of April 1781, he marched from Wilmington, North Carolina,
for Petersburg, Virginia, a distance of 800 miles: here he arrived on
the 20th of May, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span> undergoing the greatest privations and
hardships, which Lord Cornwallis deplored, and felt the distresses of
his little army so much that he became very ill with a fever, which
prevented the possibility of his lordship's sitting a horse, and made it
indispensably requisite for his being conveyed in a waggon over
mountains, rivers, and creeks.</p>

<p>On the 4th of July the troops marched from Williamsburg, the capital of
Virginia, for James Town, near which place there was a river three miles
wide, which the army had to cross. On the 5th, the baggage of the army
passed over the river, and some of the troops. The day following, Lord
Cornwallis received intelligence that the Marquis De La Fayette with
2000 Americans were within a short distance of the British, with the
intention of destroying the rear guard: upon this, his lordship
prevented the main body of his little corps from embarking, and placed
it in ambush behind a high hill to wait the attack of the enemy. About
four o'clock in the afternoon, the Americans began to attack the
piquets, which had orders to sustain their ground as long as possible;
in consequence, several officers and soldiers were wounded: at length
the main body of the enemy formed in front of the British, when the
latter, after receiving the repeated discharges of the former from two
six-pounders and musquetry, advanced, with the greatest impetuosity,
fired a volley and charged, which completely dispersed the Americans,
who were pursued until dark, the enemy leaving the two pieces of cannon
and more than 300 killed and wounded on the field. Another hour of
day-light would in all probability have prevented a single man of the
Americans escaping.</p>

<p>Earl Cornwallis was so well pleased with his little army, that in his
despatches he mentioned, that he could not sufficiently commend the
spirit and good behaviour of the officers and soldiers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span> On the 25th of
July the little corps marched for Portsmouth, and arrived at York Town
and Gloucester on the 9th of August, when orders were issued to fortify
both places as well as practicable. The Welsh Fusiliers were directed to
erect a redoubt on the right flank of the town, more than five hundred
yards in advance, there being a ravine between York and the position
allotted. Lord Cornwallis declared that the Fusiliers would have to
defend this post. On the 28th of September, 8000 French troops under the
command of Count Rochambeau, and 1500 American troops under General
Washington, with a large French fleet of ships of war, made their
appearance, with the avowed intention of besieging the army under Earl
Cornwallis, consisting of only 4017 men fit for duty: 1933 officers and
soldiers were wounded and sick in hospital. The night following, the
enemy broke ground within three hundred yards and continued their
approaches.</p>

<p>On the 6th of October, 3000 French grenadiers made a most vigorous
attempt to storm the right advanced redoubt, and were bravely repulsed
by only 130 officers and soldiers of the royal Welsh Fusiliers, and 40
marines. Two other attempts were made by the French to take the redoubt,
which proved equally unsuccessful. For the gallant defence made by the
troops in the right redoubt, they received the particular thanks of Earl
Cornwallis, and also the most flattering testimonials of approbation and
of admiration from the general officers of the army, for their intrepid
conduct during the siege, and upon all other occasions. Even the French
general officers, after the termination of the siege, gave the Welsh
Fusiliers their unqualified praises for their firmness and courage in
repulsing the three attacks made by such vastly superior numbers on the
redoubt, and could not be easily convinced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span> that so few men defended it.
Captain Saumarez was the second officer in command in the advanced right
redoubt.</p>

<p>On the 19th of October 1781, the garrison of York Town capitulated. Lord
Cornwallis having ordered that one captain and three subalterns of each
regiment be required to remain with the prisoners, the captains drew
lots, when Captain Saumarez proved so unfortunate as to be the one to
remain with the regiment, in order to visit the non-commissioned
officers and soldiers very frequently; to be an eye-witness of their
treatment; to take care that the quantity and quality of the provisions
issued to them were conformable to the terms of the capitulation; to
distribute clothing and necessaries, and also to be of every other use
and benefit to them in his power. On the 29th of October, he marched
from York Town with the regiment, and arrived on the 15th November at
Winchester, in the back settlements of Virginia, where the soldiers were
confined in barracks, surrounded with a stockade. The 12th of January
1782, he marched with the regiment and a part of Lord Cornwallis's army
from Winchester, through the State of Maryland to Lancaster in
Pennsylvania, where they arrived the 28th following. The cold was so
intense during the march, which proved so harassing and fatiguing, that
many of the men were frost-bitten, and many others suffered exceedingly.</p>

<p>The 2nd of June 1782, Captain Saumarez and the other twelve captains<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
taken prisoners with the army under Earl Cornwallis, were ordered by the
American Congress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span> and General Washington to assemble at Lancaster, in
Pennsylvania; and to draw lots, that one might be selected to suffer
death by way of retaliation, when the lot fell on Sir Charles Asgill,
who was in consequence conveyed under a strong escort to the American
army, stationed in the Jerseys, the place fixed upon for his execution.
Here he remained in prison for six months, enduring the greatest
hardships, expecting daily that his execution would take place. The
manner adopted for drawing lots, was by placing the names of the
thirteen captains in one hat, and in another twelve blank pieces of
paper, beginning with the names one by one, and by each piece of paper,
until the paper was drawn upon which was written the "<i>unfortunate</i>." It
may be observed that Captain Asgill had to pass through Philadelphia,
where the Congress was assembled; and he being attended voluntarily, and
most humanely, by Major Gordon, of the 80th regiment, the senior officer
of the British troops prisoners of war, he made it his business to wait
upon the French Ambassador, and desired in the most impressive manner
his Excellency's interference with the Congress, to prevent the
execution of Captain Asgill. The Ambassador refused complying with the
entreaty, but it was thought he afterwards relented, as he was seen
going to Congress; and that his remonstrances, together with the strong
representations of the captains, who wrote and applied in the most
decided manner to General Count De Rochambeau, who commanded the French
troops in besieging York Town, had the effect of at least suspending the
sanguinary intentions of Congress and of General Washington, to put
Captain Asgill to death, until the Government and the Queen of France,
to whom application had been made to interfere in his behalf, and if
possible save his life, were ascertained. The only reason alleged for
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span> above transactions, was, that a rebel captain named Huddy, who was
patrolling with Americans, fell in at night with another patrol of
royalists commanded by Captain Lippencott, who was taken prisoner by
Huddy, and who, without trial or any other cause but his being a
loyalist attached to the British army, hung poor Lippencott. The
latter's brother, shortly after this most infamous occurrence, was
patrolling and took Huddy prisoner, upon which, to retaliate for the
murder of his brother, he executed Huddy. The above transactions were
made known to the thirteen captains whilst prisoners on parole, and
credited by them. They were also informed very frequently, that General
Washington had often declared, that of the two events of his life which
grieved him and that he lamented most, one was his not having done his
utmost to prevent the thirteen captains taken by capitulation drawing
lots.</p>

<p>Captain Saumarez being the senior officer of the British troops, during
the time they were prisoners at Winchester and at York Town, in
Pennsylvania, had the charge and superintendence of 3000 men, stationed
at each of these places during nineteen months, which caused the
greatest anxiety, and often-times the utmost distress. In consequence of
his unremitting zeal and exertions upon this arduous service for the
comfort and welfare of the soldiers under his superintendence, as well
as to prevent their deserting to the enemy, from whom they received
every enticement to do so, he was frequently offered passports and
encouragements to go to England, and abandon the soldiers, by the
American authorities; but flattering himself that he was most useful to
them, and being impelled by a sense of public duty, he voluntarily
continued a prisoner on parole, until, in May 1783, he had the
satisfaction at the end of the war of conducting the first division of
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span> army to New York, where upon his arrival he was honoured in
obtaining the thanks and approval for his conduct from Sir Guy Carleton,
the Commander-in-chief, and also from the Field Officers of the Royal
Welsh Fusiliers.</p>

<p>Soon after his arrival within the British lines, he was permitted to
embark for England. On landing at Portsmouth, he had the mortification
of hearing he had been placed on half-pay, in consequence of the army
having been reduced, although he had fought in three general actions,
several skirmishes, and two sieges, since he purchased his company in
1779. Having repeatedly offered his services, he was preferred to a
company in the Royal Welsh Fusiliers in 1787, upon the augmentation of
the army, and when war was expected to take place; but was unfortunately
reduced three months after, as the peace continued. In 1789, he was
appointed to a company in the 7th or Royal Fusilier regiment, and joined
it in Scotland: soon after he embarked at Leith for Gibraltar, to join
his colonel, his Royal Highness Prince Edward, who was pleased to form a
company selected from all the bad and worst-behaved soldiers in the
regiment, and appointed Captain Saumarez to command and take charge of
them: some time after this, he was honoured with his Royal Highness's
best thanks, for the reformation he had caused in the conduct and
discipline of these men, and for doing this without corporal punishment.
The Duke was pleased to honour him with the appointment of Equerry, and
afterwards of Groom of the Chamber to his Royal Highness.</p>

<p>In 1791, he embarked with the regiment for Canada, and soon after this
he was permitted to go to England. In 1793, on the declaration of war
with France, he offered his services to raise a regiment, when Mr.
Secretary Dundas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span> and Major General Thomas Dundas, the latter being
appointed to command-in-chief at Guernsey, earnestly solicited him to
accompany the Major General to the island, on account of his knowledge
of the language, the laws, and customs of the island, and of its
inhabitants; and being informed that the enemy meditated to attack it,
he was induced to accept the appointment of Major of Brigade to 2000
militia of the island: he besides voluntarily did the duty of the
quarter-master-general's department to the troops. He also had the
superintendence and examination of all strangers as they landed, which
enabled him to cause many disaffected persons and rebels from Ireland to
be apprehended: he had the selection and appointment of pilots to the
ships of war requiring them, and otherwise rendered himself as useful as
possible to the public service, without additional pay or emolument
whatever, for the space of five years, and until the arrival of 7000
Russian troops, when he was appointed assistant quarter-master-general,
and, upon four French corps arriving in the island, he was appointed
their inspector.</p>

<p>Mr. Secretary Dundas, and Mr. Windham, secretary at war, were pleased to
confide to him the secret correspondence with the enemy's coast, from
Havre to Brest, when he obtained intelligence of the utmost importance,
for which he repeatedly received the thanks of His Majesty's ministers.
In 1794, he was deputed to carry an address from the States of the
island, on the marriage of his Royal Highness the Prince Regent; and on
this occasion Major General Small, who was the Lieutenant-Governor and
Commander-in-chief, was pleased to recommend his services in so strong a
manner to the King's ministers, that he had the honour of being
knighted. In 1799 he was promoted to be inspector of the militia of the
island, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span> which situation he continued to serve until June, 1811, when
he obtained the rank of major general.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>In February 1812, Sir Thomas was appointed commandant of the garrison at
Halifax, Nova Scotia; and in August 1813 he had the honour of going as
President of the Council, and to command in chief the province of New
Brunswick. In July 1814, he returned to Halifax, and soon after he
embarked for England.</p>

<p>Before his departure from New Brunswick, His Majesty's Council presented
him the following address:</p>

<p>"To his Honour Major General Sir Thomas Saumarez, late President and
Commander-in-chief of the province of New Brunswick.</p>

<p class="center smcap">"the address of his majesty's council.</p>
<p class="right">"Fredericton, 6th July 1814.</p>
<p class="smcap">"Sir,</p>

<p>"The unsettled state of the government in New Brunswick has long been
a subject of general regret in the province, where the changes of
President have occurred no less than nine times in the course of seven
years. But although the period of your Honour's administration in
particular has been short, it will not be soon forgotten; it has made
a lasting impression on the minds of all such as have had opportunity
to observe, and justly to appreciate, your vigilant and unwearied
attention to the duties<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span> of your station, and your constant ambition,
by every means in your power, to promote and secure the prosperity of
the colony committed to your care. His Majesty's Council therefore
request your acceptance of this address, not as a mere compliment, but
as a sincere tribute of respect and esteem; which, together with their
best wishes, they offer in the confident assurance that, on this
occasion, they speak the sentiments of the province at large."</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Saumarez, who had long been the senior Lieutenant General in
Her Majesty's army, was advanced to the rank of General at the
Coronation of Her most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas has almost constantly resided in his native island, and no
one has done more in promoting its improvement. Those who have visited
Guernsey with an introduction to him, and even perfect strangers, will
gratefully remember his hospitality. He was long the highly esteemed
friend of Her present Majesty's illustrious father, his Royal Highness
the Duke of Kent; and he is no less esteemed for the urbanity of his
manners and kindness of heart. The author can testify, that those who
know Sir Thomas Saumarez have a sincere and invaluable friend.</p></div>

<h4>BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR OF CAPTAIN PHILIP DE SAUMAREZ.</h4>
<p class="p2"></p>
<div class="font95">
<p>The deeds of this brave and meritorious officer, who was the uncle of
the noble Lord whose memoirs we have recorded in these volumes, would
probably have been buried in oblivion, had not some official documents
been discovered, of which we have gladly availed ourselves in presenting
to the public a more full and authentic account of his glorious career
than has hitherto been given.</p>

<p>Philip de Saumarez was the third son of Mathew de Saumarez of Guernsey,
and Anne Durell, born at Guernsey 17th of November 1710. At an early age
he was removed from his native isle to a grammar school at Jersey, where
he continued under the immediate patronage of his aunt, Lady de
Carteret, till the age of eleven, when with the view of making himself a
proficient in mathematics and classics, as well as of acquiring the
English language, which at that period was but partially spoken in these
islands, he was sent to Southampton, and there placed under the care of
Mr. Isaac Watts and Mrs. Kinsman. That he made considerable proficiency
in learning, and employed the short time which in those days was devoted
to education, preparatory to entering the service to advantage, may be
justly inferred, if we may judge from the style of his letters, and from
the precision and accuracy which mark the astronomical observations to
be found in his journals.</p>

<p>At Southampton he remained about two years and a half, when he met with
his uncle Captain James Durell, of the Royal Navy, a brave and
distinguished officer, who took him to Greenwich, with the view of
placing him in the Royal Navy, which he was soon after able to
accomplish.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span> Mr. Philip de Saumarez commenced his naval career on the
4th of February 1726, under Captain Charles Kendal, in his Majesty's
ship Weymouth of fifty guns, then attached to the Baltic station, from
whence she returned in November. In the spring of the year 1727, she was
ordered to the Nore to attend his Majesty George II, then going to
Holland, and in the month of August she sailed for Gibraltar and the
Mediterranean station.</p>

<p>On the 1st December 1727, he was removed from the Weymouth to the
Gibraltar of twenty guns, commanded by the Hon. George Byng, who was
succeeded by Captain John Stanley, with whom our young officer served
till the 20th December 1729, on which day he joined Captain Byng in the
Princess Louisa, of sixty guns, and sailed under his command till the
7th July 1730, when Captain Byng, having been appointed to the Falmouth
of fifty guns, removed into the latter ship, and took Mr. De Saumarez
with him, who had now served the necessary time, and had received
flattering testimonials from his respective captains. Captain Byng
mentioning that he was deserving of promotion, he obtained leave to go
to London to pass his examination, which he did on the 17th of October
1732, at which period he had served above six years and seven months.</p>

<p>After passing, he immediately rejoined the Falmouth, and continued to
serve two years longer as midshipman and master's mate. He now became
extremely anxious for that promotion to which his services and excellent
conduct so justly entitled him. He therefore returned home to apply for
it, receiving a very strong certificate from Captain Byng, dated 25th
June 1734. In August following he arrived in London; and several
officers, among whom Capt. Saunders appears to be foremost, having
recommended him for promotion as a most deserving officer, he was
placed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span> on the Admiralty list, being appointed as midshipman and
subsequently as master's mate to the Blenheim, of ninety guns, bearing
the flag of Admiral Cavendish. Having arrived at the West Indies, he was
appointed to the Dunkirk on the Jamaica station, anxiously waiting for
promotion. He was above two years in that ungenial climate, where his
health became much impaired before he received his commission. Several
letters he wrote to his friends express his extreme desire to obtain it,
as will be seen by the following short extract:</p></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>"12th January 1737&mdash;I wish I had it in my power reciprocally to
enhance our satisfaction by acquainting you with my advancement; that
period has not yet arrived; fortune seems in regard to me to be at a
stand, and I find that I am obliged to fill the chasm by a constant
perseverance of patience: probably this season may prove more
auspicious, and I am in hopes of shortly seeing some revolution to my
advantage."</p></div>

<div class="font95">
<p>The season after did indeed prove the fatal effects of the climate, on
which subject he thus writes to his brother: "We have undergone a
severe season this summer, heat being excessive, attended with calms
that rendered it insupportable; this has occasioned a great mortality,
and made death quite familiar to us, it being the usual thing to
attend the funeral of the friends we conversed with the day before.
Though this made us a kind of mechanic philosophers, (if I may use the
term,) I do not observe that it contributes towards rectifying the
morals of the inhabitants here, or making us better Christians."</p>

<p>On the 6th of August 1737, he at last succeeded in obtaining his
long-expected promotion as lieutenant from Admiral Digby Dent,
Commander-in-chief at Jamaica. This pleasing intelligence was
communicated in a letter to Lady Carteret, dated the 10th of October
1737, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span> mentions that he was appointed lieutenant of the Kinsale of
forty guns, and that the Admiral signed his commission only three hours
before his death. On the 28th July, he was removed from the Kinsale by
the Commander-in-chief, but on the 22nd of August he received his
confirmation from the Admiralty to the Diamond, which confirmed also
both the former. He returned to England in October 1739, when he visited
his friends in Guernsey and Jersey, and recruited his health, which was
naturally delicate, and had been seriously impaired by the West Indian
climate; but the imperious demands of active service soon called him
away.</p>

<p>It was in this year that the memorable voyage round the world was
projected, and shortly after the command was given to Commodore Anson,
who had the privilege of selecting the officers who were to serve under
him on that interesting and important enterprise, when Mr. Saumarez was
chosen as second lieutenant of the Centurion of sixty guns, his own
ship; besides which the squadron consisted of the Gloucester, fifty
guns, Captain Norris; the Severn, fifty guns, Captain Legge; of the
Pearl, forty guns, Capt. Mitchell; of the Wager, twenty-eight, Captain
Kidd; and the Tryal of eight guns, Captain E. Murray; besides the
Centaur store-ship and two victuallers, the Anna and Industry Pinks.</p>

<p>From numberless delays injurious to the expedition, it was not before
the 17th of September 1740 that the Commodore was able to leave St.
Helen's, and proceed on his intended voyage.</p>

<p>As the account of the proceedings of Commodore Anson has been published
in almost every naval history as well as in the biographical memoirs of
that illustrious navigator, it need not be repeated here, and we shall
therefore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span> confine ourselves to the part in which the conduct of Lieut.
Saumarez was conspicuous.</p>

<p>Lieut. Saumarez in 1741 was made acting commander of the Tryal, in the
place of Lieutenant Saunders, who was appointed to the vacancy
occasioned by the death of Captain Kidd, but who from ill-health was not
in a state to be removed from the Centurion. In this situation he
remained seven weeks, during which time he gave proofs of his consummate
skill during a period of excessively inclement weather. Captain
Saunders, on his recovery, assumed the command on the 19th February,
when he returned to the Centurion as first lieutenant.</p>

<p>The following account given by Lieutenant Saumarez of the action with
the Spanish Galleon, off Manilla, cannot be read without much interest.
It is dated on board the Centurion, 1742.</p></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>"I shall run over briefly the dates of our voyage, and give you a rude
sketch of our proceedings: to enlarge on particulars would exceed the
limits of a letter.</p>

<p>"You will recollect our squadron left England on the 18th September
1740. We had a tedious passage of forty-one days to Madeira, the usual
one being ten; to this accident several secondary ones succeeded, as
loss of time, and the season proper for navigating the Southern seas,
and declining health of the men, especially the soldiers. We stayed a
month at this island, employed in watering, and taking in our stock of
wine. It is highly probable that we narrowly escaped a squadron of the
enemy, which were discovered from the mountains, cruising off the west
end of the island, and which, if the commanders had behaved like
disciplinarians, might have intercepted us, and it would have fully
answered the designs of the Spanish court if they had disabled us from
pursuing our voyage,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span> which must have been the consequence of an
engagement. They had also the advantage of being double our number;
but, leaving them to their reflections, we pursued our course, and
crossed the line and tropic without any remarkable accidents
occurring, excepting that fever and fluxes began to attack us,
especially the soldiers; and in forty-four days we arrived at the
island of St. Catherine, on the coast of Brazil, on the 19th March
1740.</p>

<p>"We stayed at St. Catherine's twenty-eight days, employed in
recovering our sick, who lived on shore in tents, and in making
preparations for doubling Cape Horn in a tempestuous and advanced
season.</p>

<p>"We sailed hence on the 18th of January 1741, and soon after began to
meet with uncertain, stormy weather, in which the Tryal sloop lost her
mainmast, and was towed by one of the squadron; the rest separated
from us, but as our rendezvous was at St. Julien's, a port on the
coast of Patagonia, or, as others term it, Terra Magellanica, in 49°
30' South, we rejoined them there, by which we heard of Pizarro's
squadron, from whom we narrowly escaped off Pepy's Island. We stayed
here eight days, employed in putting all our lumber on board the
store-ship, and were in hopes of meeting with the Spanish squadron.</p>

<p>"The coast here is a sulphureous and nitrous soil, abounding with salt
lakes, but destitute of verdure, shrub, tree, or fresh water, and
seems the seat of infernal spirits; nor indeed was there the trace of
any animals, besides seals and birds. We here took in salt and
refitted the sloop.</p>

<p>"Captain Kidd's death made a revolution by promotion amongst us, and I
was appointed first lieutenant of the Commodore; but my predecessor,
to whose command the sloop descended, was taken dangerously ill, and
became incapable of taking possession of his charge. I was ordered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span> to
take the command until his recovery; and here I must confess to you, I
was sanguine enough to flatter myself with the same addition of good
fortune, some favourable crisis in my behalf: but I was born to be
unfortunate.</p>

<p>"We sailed hence on the 27th of February 1741: my station was a-head
of the squadron, to keep sounding and make timely signals of danger.</p>

<p>"The 4th of March we discovered the entrance of the Strait of
Magellan, and on the 7th passed through the Strait le Main, lying at
the extremity of Terra del Fuego, between that and Staten Land.</p>

<p>"This day was remarkably warm and favourable, and though in latitude
55° 50' South, we began to look on the conquest of the Peruvian mines
and principal towns in the Pacific sea as an amusement, which would
naturally occur. From this time forward, we met with nothing but
disasters and accidents. Never were the passions of hope and fear so
powerfully agitated and exercised; the very elements seemed combined
against us. I commanded the sloop at the time of the separation of the
ships that returned home, being stationed to look out for islands of
ice; and had to endure such fatigue from the severity of the weather,
and the duty which the nature of the service necessarily brought on
me, that really my life was hardly worth preserving at the expense of
such hardships. Our own ships had several miraculous escapes, which,
in the obscurity of the night and the violence of the weather, often
endangered foundering the sloop.</p>

<p>"Having had the command of the sloop several weeks, I was at length
superseded by her proper captain, who had recovered on board the
Commodore's ship; and I returned to my post.</p>

<p>"During this time, the scurvy made terrible havoc among us, especially
the soldiers, who, being either infirm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span> old men or raw inexperienced
youths, soon lost their spirits, grew sick and disabled, and from the
stench they occasioned, contributed to infect our seamen.</p>

<p>"This distemper is the consequence of long voyages, and exhibits
itself in such dreadful symptoms as are scarcely credible, viz.
asthma, pains in the limbs and joints, blotches all over the body,
ulcers, idiotism, lunacy, convulsions, and sudden death. Nor can the
physicians, with all their <i>materia medica</i>, find a remedy for it
equal to the smell of turf, grass, or a dish of greens. It is not my
province to account for what is a matter of much doubt and perplexity
even to the most learned, but I could plainly observe that there is a
<i>je ne sais quoi</i> in the frame of the human system, that cannot be
removed without the assistance of certain earthy particles, or, in
plain English, the landsman's proper aliment, and vegetables and
fruits his only physic. For the space of six weeks we seldom buried
less than four or five daily, and at last it amounted to eight or ten;
and I really believe, that, had we stayed ten days longer at sea, we
should have lost the ship for want of men to navigate her.</p>

<p>"At length we arrived at the island of Juan Fernandez, in the South
Sea, after having had several imminent dangers of shipwreck on the
coast of Chili, off which the nature of our rendezvous required us to
cruise, in hopes of rejoining the squadron.</p>

<p>"We anchored here on the 16th June 1741, as we subsequently learned,
just ten days after the departure of a Spanish ship of war, which was
sent by the Admiral of these seas to gain intelligence, himself having
cruised with his squadron of four sail a considerable time, in hopes
of meeting with us, well judging the condition our ships might be in.
You will be surprised to hear that in a sixty gun ship, on our arrival
at this island, we mustered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span> but seventy-two persons, including
officers and boys, capable of appearing on deck; the rest being all
sick, having lost 228 since our leaving England, which includes nine
months.</p>

<p>"We were joined by the Gloucester and Tryal sloop, (vide Anson's
Voyage, p. 114,) the crews of which vessels had suffered still more,
so that had there been an experienced enemy to have dealt with us,
they might have made a very easy conquest of us all. But, 'whatever
is, is right.' They gave us time to recover our spirits and rally our
forces, for which we visited them afterwards and shut up their ports.</p>

<p>"I shall not attempt a description of this island at present, but only
tell you it is the most romantic and pleasant place imaginable,
abounding with myrtle trees, and covered with turnips and sorrel. Its
bays, teeming with all kinds of fish, seem calculated for the
reception of distressed seamen. We stayed here three months, employed
in refitting our ships, and restoring the health of the sick, and this
without any loss of time to us, it being the winter season, in which,
from April to September, navigation is judged unsafe by the Spaniards.
In the beginning of this month (September) we were agreeably surprised
by the sight of a sail, to which we immediately gave chase, slipping
our cable; but night intervening, we lost her. We soon after fell in
with another, who was her consort, of 500 tons, and much richer,
having about 18,000<i>l.</i> in money on board, besides a cargo, which
would have been valuable (being chiefly sugar) could we have brought
it to a proper market; but in these parts it is a misfortune that
nothing but money is truly valuable, having no ports whereat to
dispose of anything. Here I commenced captain again, in the Tryal's
prize, having twelve guns, besides swivels, with thirty men,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span> and had
a separate cruise ordered me with Captain Saunders. (Vide Anson's
Voyage, p. 114.) She was a ship he had taken in the sloop, which then
proved so leaky and disabled in her masts by a gale of wind, that she
was sunk, and her prize commissioned in her room. As nothing appeared
on our station, which was to leeward of Valparaiso, we had no
opportunity of exerting ourselves. We next proceeded along the coast
of Peru, and took two prizes, both very valuable to the Spaniards, the
one being loaded with ship timber, and the other with iron bars, but
to us of no great service; by the latter, (viz. the Nuestra Senora del
Carmin, 250 tons of cargo, value 400,000 dollars,) we had information
of a rich vessel in the road of Paita, bound to Lousuata on the coast
of Mexico, the money being still in town. This was a chance worth
pursuing; and having arrived off the port in the night, we sent in all
the boats manned and armed, with fifty men, surprised and took the
town with scarcely any resistance or loss, except one killed and one
wounded on our side; the inhabitants abandoning their houses, and
retiring to the neighbouring mountains.</p>

<p>"This event happened on the 15th of November 1741. (Vide Anson's
Voyage, p. 149.) We kept possession of the town two days and a half
without any disturbance from the natives, and, having plundered it,
set it on fire, but spared the two churches.</p>

<p>"We found here about 30,000<i>l.</i> besides jewels; there was much more,
but the inhabitants carried it off. We sunk two galleys and two snows,
and carried away with us the small ship that was to have carried the
money. We departed hence on the 16th, and some days after joined the
Gloucester, which had been ranging the coast, and intercepted some
vessels, though not so valuable as ours. We then proceeded along
shore, burning some of our prizes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span> which proved dull sailers, and
arrived at the island of Quibo, 17th December 1741, a delightful
uninhabited place, abounding with wild deer and other refreshments.
Having watered here with all imaginable expedition, we sailed hence on
the 19th December, with a design to cruise off Acapulco, on the coast
of Mexico, for a rich ship that was expected from Manilla, on the
island of Luconia, in the East Indies.</p>

<p>"There is a yearly ship whose cargo amounts to an immense sum, and
could we but have had a favourable passage thither, she must
indubitably have been ours; but we were disappointed, having been
seventy-nine days in effecting a passage which has been performed in
twenty, meeting with a long series of calms and uncertain weather.
Hence we arrived five weeks too late, and therefore hoped to speak her
on her return, which generally is in March; she would then have been
laden with money to purchase another cargo. We cruized off this port
and the coast of Mexico two months, at a distance not to be discovered
from the shore, and having intelligence, by a boat we took, of the day
of her sailing, we made no doubt of her being ours. We were five sail
in all, with our prizes, and lay at three leagues distance from each
other, and ten from the port. During this time we lived on turtle,
which we caught daily in our boats. Our squadron described a half
moon, our boats being at the same time three leagues from the shore
within us to watch the port. The disposition was so just and regular,
it was impossible she could have escaped. I was so curious as to
calculate my share, which would have amounted to 10,000<i>l.</i>; but
Providence ordained it otherwise.</p>

<p>"I should have told you that that ship mounted sixty guns. Having
cruised till our water was almost all expended, and having an enemy's
coast whereon to replenish,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span> we were obliged to depart, but left a
boat behind to watch her motions. After many searches, we found a
convenient bay for watering called Chequetan, where Sir Francis Drake
had refitted. We sunk and burnt all our prizes, in order to cross the
great Southern Ocean, and, with the Gloucester in company, go to the
East Indies. We learned afterwards that this rich ship was detained,
having had information from the coast of Peru of our being on the
coast. We left Acapulco on the 6th of May 1742; and here begins
another series of misfortunes and mortality surpassing the first. We
had a passage of three months and a half to the Ladrone Islands, which
is generally made in two; yet it was a vulgar opinion amongst our
people that we had sailed so far as to pass by all the land in the
world! Length of time and badness of the weather rendered both our
ships leaky; this, joined to our mortality, the scurvy raging amongst
us as much as ever, obliged us to destroy the Gloucester, which ship
was ready to founder, and receive the men on board, who were all sick
and dying. It is impossible to represent the melancholy circumstances
wherein we were involved previous to our arrival at these islands. We
anchored at one called Tinian, uninhabited, but abounding with wild
cattle, hogs, fowls, and fruits: we could not have fallen in with a
better place. I am convinced, had we stayed out ten days longer at
sea, we should have been obliged to take to our boats, our leak
increasing so fast, and our people being all infirm and disabled. We
immediately sent all our sick on shore, and began to hope for better
times, feeding plentifully on roast beef, when an accident fell out,
on the 22nd September 1742, which nearly ruined us all.</p>

<p>"My post as first officer generally confined me on board the
Commodore, whilst most of the officers and men were on shore for the
recovery of their health, when a storm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span> came on and rose so
mountainous a sea as none of us ever saw before. The ship was in
danger of being pooped as we lay at anchor; at last we parted both our
bower-cables and drove out to sea, with the sheet-anchor hanging in
the hawse, a whole cable and three quarters of another out (excuse
these barbarous sea terms), and narrowly escaped driving on a ledge of
rocks, that was near, and leaving the Commodore and all the rest
behind. The ship, by her labouring in such a troubled sea, made so
much water that I was in doubt whether she would not have foundered;
our ports and the guns were but ill-secured, owing to the suddenness
of the storm, which also upset the long boat. Under these
circumstances we drove to sea with one hundred men and boys on board,
not knowing whether I should not at last be a captain in spite of my
teeth. In this manner I drove seventy leagues, and was fifteen days
before I recovered land, beating up against a fresh trade and the
current. The Commodore, you may imagine, was overjoyed at my return,
as were all the rest. They were very busy in building a vessel to
carry them all to China, as they preferred venturing to sea in it to
remaining in an uninhabited island, or to be exposed to the cruelty of
the Spaniards who live in the neighbouring islands, the Commodore
concluding that either the ship was lost, or that I should never be
able to beat to windward. At last, after many hazards, we sailed on
the 22nd of October 1742, and met with a tolerably good passage to the
island of Macoa, a Portuguese settlement on the coast of China, where
we arrived on the 11th November, having buried one hundred and sixty
men since our leaving Acapulco, or four hundred and twenty since we
left England, including Indians and negroes, whom we detained as
prisoners."</p></div>

<p>Commodore Anson arrived at Macoa, and having careened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span> and repaired the
ship, and been reinforced by some Lascars or Indian sailors, and by some
Dutchmen, he sailed from Macoa on the 1st May, giving out that he was
bound to Batavia, Captain Saunders of the Gloucester having gone to
England in a Swedish ship; but when fairly at sea he made known to his
crew that he was going to cruise off Manilla for the purpose of
intercepting the two galleons expected there, one of which he ultimately
took on the 20th June, just a month after they arrived off the station,
after a severe action, in which the galleon, which was called the Nostra
Signora Cabadonga, commanded by General Don Jeronimo de Montivo, had
sixty-seven killed and eighty-four wounded, while the Centurion had only
two killed, and a lieutenant and sixteen men wounded. Lieut. Saumarez,
who had highly distinguished himself in this action, was now made Post
Captain of the prize, which he safely conducted to Canton. She had on
board 400,000<i>l.</i> in specie, besides property estimated at 600,000<i>l.</i>
which was destroyed; he had now therefore obtained his rank, and a
considerable share of prize money.</p>

<p>On the 7th of December 1743, they sailed from Canton, and arrived in
England, to be welcomed by their families and friends, on the 15th June
1744, after an absence of four years, wherein they had endured hardships
of every description. Captain Saumarez went to Bath for the recovery of
his health. He subsequently served in the Sandwich, York, and Yarmouth:
in the York he encountered a heavy gale, in which his superior
seamanship was severely put to the test. He was subsequently removed to
the Nottingham, of sixty guns, and on the 11th October 1747 fell in with
the Mars, a French sixty-four gun-ship, with five hundred men, commanded
by M. de Colombe, being one of the ships that had separated from
D'Anville's fleet in the storm off Newfoundland. She was returning to
Brest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span> The Nottingham had sixty guns and four hundred men. After an
engagement of two hours within pistol shot, in which the Mars had
twenty-three killed and nineteen wounded, she struck. On board the
Nottingham only three men were killed and nine wounded, which was
attributed to the superior seamanship of the Captain, who obtained an
advantageous position in the battle.</p>

<p>Captain Saumarez had been often heard to say that his highest ambition
was to fall in with an enemy of equal force, and on this occasion his
honourable feelings were completely gratified. He received
congratulations from all his friends, and particularly from the Lords of
the Admiralty, who expressed their highest approbation of the skill and
courage he displayed on this occasion; but his mild, liberal, and
generous treatment to a vanquished enemy was no less conspicuous in this
instance than his bravery; it was indeed one of the strongest traits in
his character. On this subject he received the following letter from the
Secretary of the Admiralty:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>"The Chevalier de Crenay, late Captain of the Mars, having taken
notice to the Lords of the Admiralty, in a letter their lordships
received from him and his officers and company, I am commanded to let
you know, that your civil treatment of them after they were taken, has
been no less satisfactory to their lordships than your resolution and
success in taking them.</p>

<p class="left65">"I am, sir, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">"Thos. Corbett, Sec."</p></div>

<p>A letter from Chevalier Crenay himself is written in the strongest
terms of gratitude and regard; after enumerating many civilities, he
declares that every article had been restored, even to a box of
porcelain, and that his officers and men all joined in offering their
grateful thanks. It may be added, that Captain Saumarez did all in
his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span> power to obtain Captain Crenay's exchange. The Mars was carried
into Plymouth, and being found worthy of repair, was, from the
representation of Captain Saumarez, taken into his Majesty's service:
she was nearly 300 tons larger than the Nottingham, and found
afterwards to be an excellent ship.</p>

<p>Captain Saumarez' ship was speedily refitted, and on the 3rd May 1747,
he joined Lord Anson's squadron, which obtained a complete victory
over the French fleet, commanded by M. Jonquière, taking six
men-of-war and three East Indiamen. After the engagement, the
Nottingham, with two more ships, was detached to pursue the convoy,
and had the good fortune to capture four very valuable vessels from
St. Domingo.</p>

<p>Captain Saumarez afterwards cruised under Admiral Warren, and on the
10th of September following he was ordered to join Admiral Hawke: he
remained with that officer until the 14th October, when the Admiral
came up with a French fleet, commanded by Monsieur De l'Etendiere, off
Cape Finisterre, which he defeated, and took six of the enemy's ships;
but the Tonnant, an 80 gun ship, with the Intrepide, 74, having
escaped, Captain Saumarez, with the Yarmouth and Eagle, immediately
gave chase to them. Having come up with the Tonnant, although the
Nottingham was so unequal in size and number of guns, he gallantly
engaged her before the other two English ships joined. After about an
hour's close action, a shot from the enemy put an end to the existence
of this brave officer, who, during his whole life, had served his king
and country with honour and zeal; he died lamented by all those to
whom he was known.</p>

<p>The following is an extract from the Rear-admiral's despatch: "Having
observed that six of the enemy's ships<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span> had struck, and it being very
dark, and our own ships dispersed, I thought it best to bring to that
night, and seeing a great firing a long way astern of me, I was in
hopes of seeing more of the enemy's ships taken in the morning; but,
instead of that, I received the melancholy account of Captain Saumarez
being killed, and that the Tonnant had escaped in the night, with the
assistance of the Intrepide, who, by having the wind of our ships, had
received no damage that I could perceive."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The last will of Captain Philip Saumarez is an interesting document,
inasmuch as it portrays his true character as an officer and a
Christian, impressed with the uncertainty of human life, and almost
anticipating the glorious fate which ultimately befel him; and as it
is also replete with piety, morality, gratitude, and the other virtues
which adorn the life of a hero, we shall conclude this memoir with
some extracts taken from the original, which begins thus:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>"I, Philip Saumarez, commander of H.M.S. Nottingham, from a reflection
of the uncertainty of human life in general, particularly when engaged
in a military profession: in order therefore to face death cheerfully,
whenever duty or nature shall call upon me, I hereby dispose of
whatever Providence has blessed me with, in the following manner:</p>

<p>"To my honoured mother, I bequeath the sum of 1500<i>l.</i> to be paid
after my father's death, and until then to remain at interest; if she
dies before him, to be divided equally among my eldest brother John's
children.</p>

<p>"To my sister Anne, 300<i>l.</i> To my sister Elizabeth, 300<i>l.</i></p>

<p>"To my brother John, 1000<i>l.</i> all my silver plate, and a diamond ring,
formerly belonging to Lady Carteret.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>

<p>"To my niece and godchild, Carteret Saumarez, my brother John's
daughter, I bequeath 1000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>"My brother Matthew Saumarez, 1500<i>l.</i> and all my books; and to his
daughter, 500<i>l.</i></p>

<p>"My brother Thomas Saumarez, 1000<i>l.</i> with all my linen, liquors,
furniture, and apparel.</p>

<p>"My brother-in-law, Philip Durell and his wife, I bequeath 50<i>l.</i>
each, their fortunes being sufficient: his wife to buy mourning.</p>

<p>"To my aunt Durell, at Westminster, 100<i>l.</i></p>

<p>"My aunt Sauvaine, 10<i>l.</i> to buy mourning.</p>

<p>"Mr. Solomon Durell, 40<i>l.</i></p>

<p>"To my worthy friend James Wallace, commissioner of the victualling
office, 100<i>l.</i></p>

<p>"To my steward, 30<i>l.</i> besides a suit of mourning; and to my other
servants, 5<i>l.</i> each.</p>

<p>"In case I am killed in action, or die whilst I command the
Nottingham, to the three lieutenants a suit of mourning each, which I
beg they will accept; and to Mr. Surroude, my chaplain, I bequeath the
sum of 100<i>l.</i> in regard to his large family; and to Mr. Redley, my
clerk, the sum of 30<i>l.</i> for the trouble of making up my accounts.</p>

<p>"To Admiral Anson and Sir Peter Warren, I desire they will accept a
mourning ring each, my executors to lay out 30<i>l.</i> in each ring; and
to the former I recommend my brother Tom.</p>

<p>"I likewise desire that 300<i>l.</i> may be laid out to purchase a handsome
monument, made in London, to the memory of my late aunt, the Lady
Carteret, to be erected in the church where she is interred, and a due
epitaph, enumerating her exemplary virtues and life, to be inscribed
on it in French and English, and recorded to posterity; and this I
desire my brother John will see duly performed, as well as my other
executors, with expedition; this piece<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span> of gratitude to her memory
having been neglected by all her relations.</p>

<p>"In case it should not be attended with any inconvenience, the surgeon
to preserve and embalm my corpse, to be interred in a military manner
on shore, in whatever port the ship may put in; and the surgeon to be
presented with 30<i>l.</i> for his trouble. I bequeath to my brother
officers, Captains Thomas Coates, Martyn, Keppel, Rodney, and Timothy
Brett, a mourning ring of 10<i>l.</i> value each; the same to Mr. Logie,
first lieutenant of the Nottingham.</p>

<p>"To the poor of the parish in the island of Guernsey, where I was
born, 100<i>l.</i> to be distributed: the remainder of what fortune I may
have to bequeath, to my honoured father. And I do hereby constitute
and appoint my worthy friend Pussey Brook, Esq., James Wallace, Esq.,
and my eldest brother John Saumarez, Esq., executors of this my last
will and testament, revoking all former wills by me heretofore made.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and seal, at sea, this
30th day of June, and in the twenty-first year of the reign of our
sovereign Lord George the Second over Great Britain, France, and
Ireland, &amp;c., and in the year of our Lord 1747.</p>

<p class="right smcap"> "Philip Saumarez." (L.S.)</p>

<p>"Signed in the presence of,<br />
<span class="i2">Robert Richards, Master.</span><br />
<span class="i2">Alexander Gray, Gunner."</span></p></div>

<p>The wishes expressed in the will of this brave officer were implicitly
complied with; his body was embalmed and sent to Plymouth by the
admiral, in the Gloucester, commanded by Captain Durell, (afterwards
Admiral Durell,) his brother-in-law, and was buried in the church at
Plymouth with military honours. A neat tablet is erected in the said
church, with the following inscription:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span> "Near this place lies the
body of Philip Saumarez, Esq. commander of H.M.S. Nottingham. He was
the son of Matthew de Saumarez, of the Island of Guernsey, by Anne
Durell, of the island of Jersey, his wife, families of antiquity and
respectability in those parts. He was born 17th November 1710, and
gloriously but unfortunately fell by a cannon-ball, 14th October 1747,
pursuing the ships of the enemy that were making their escape, when
the French were routed by Admiral Hawke."</p>

<p>Out of respect to his memory, his brothers and sisters caused a plain
monument to be erected to him in Westminster Abbey, with the following
inscription:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">ORBE CIRCUMCINTO,</p>

<p>"Sacred to the memory of Philip De Saumarez, Esq., one of the few
whose lives ought rather to be measured by their actions than their
days. From sixteen to thirty-seven years of age, he served in the
navy, and was often surrounded with dangers and difficulties
unparalleled: always approving himself an able, active, and gallant
officer. He went out a lieutenant on board His Majesty's ship
Centurion, under the auspicious conduct of Commodore Anson, in his
expedition to the South Seas: he was commanding officer of the said
ship when she was driven from her moorings at the island of Tinian.</p>

<p>"In the year 1747, being captain of the Nottingham, a sixty gun ship,
he (then alone) attacked and took the Mars, a French ship of
sixty-four guns.</p>

<p>"In the first engagement in the following year, when Admiral Anson
defeated and took a squadron of French men-of-war and Indiamen, he had
an honourable share; and in the second, under Admiral Hawke, when the
enemy, after an obstinate resistance, was again routed, in pursuing
two ships that were making their escape, he gloriously but
unfortunately fell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>

<p>"He was the son of Matthew De Saumarez, of the island of Guernsey,
Esq. by Anne Durell, of the island of Jersey, his wife.</p>

<p class="center">"He was born November 17th, 1710;<br />
killed October 14th, 1747;<br />
buried in the old Church at Plymouth,<br />
with all honours due to his distinguished merits;<br />
and this monument is erected, out of<br />
gratitude and affection,<br />
by his Brothers and Sisters."</p>

<p>The first of the De Sausmarez (Saumarez) family found on the public
records of the metropolis, is Nicholas, the son of Matthew de Sausmarez,
who in 1331 made application for a confirmation of his rights and
prerogatives as formerly enjoyed by his ancestors, and whose son Thomas
was Lord of the <i>Seigneurie</i> of Sausmarez in the year 1481. Thomas
married Colishe, daughter of Nicholas Fonachin, bailiff of the island of
Guernsey, and had two sons and two daughters; one of whom, Michael,
inherited the estate, and was succeeded by his eldest son John, who in
1543 was jurat of the island of Guernsey, and married Margaret, daughter
of James Guille, then bailiff. John was succeeded by his son Thomas,
also a jurat of the Royal Court, who married Rebecca Hancock; and the
property descended to his son, likewise a jurat of the Royal Court, who
married Bertrand, daughter of Cardin Fautrart: he was succeeded by his
son Thomas, who married Martha Nicholi, and does not appear to have been
of any profession. His only son, Michael, who was married to Charlotte,
daughter of James le Marchant, jurat of the Royal Court in 1681, became
the next heir, and was succeeded by Matthew de Sausmarez, his only son,
who was the eleventh in the direct line since the year 1331. This
Matthew was born at Guernsey on the 4th June 1685, was colonel of
militia of the island, and married Anne, daughter of John Durell, Esq.
lieutenant-bailiff of the island of Jersey, on the 1st of January 1705.
By this, his first wife, he had&mdash;first, John de Sausmarez, who was born
on the 12th January 1706, and died 4th April 1774. He was Attorney
General in the island of Guernsey; and married first, Martha, daughter
of Daniel Delisle, Esq. of Guernsey, and the lady who repossessed the
estate, which had become the property of John Andros, in right of his
wife, Judith de Sausmarez. The second son died an infant. The third son
was Philip de Sausmarez,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> born on the 17th November 1710. He was
first lieutenant with Commodore Anson, and commanded the Nottingham 64,
when that ship captured the Mars, French 74. Anne married Captain Philip
Dumaresq; Elizabeth, Margaret, and Magdalen, died unmarried. Matthew
Saumarez was the fourth son; he was born on the 10th October 1718; and
was the father of the late Lord de Saumarez. He was drowned on his
passage to England in March 1778. Thomas, the fifth son, born 20th April
1720, is particularly mentioned in the commencement of this work.
William, the sixth son, was born 29th April 1722, and died in the East
Indies; and Michael, the seventh and last son, was born on the 8th
October 1725, and died an infant.</p>

<p>We now come to the brothers and sisters of the first Lord de Saumarez,
children of Matthew, the fourth son, already mentioned as remarkable for
his urbanity of manners and hospitality, particularly to strangers.</p>

<p>By his first wife, daughter of Thomas Dumaresq, Esq. of Jersey, Matthew
Saumarez had issue Susannah, an only child, who married Henry Brock,
Esq. of Guernsey: by his second wife, Carteret, daughter of James le
Marchant, Esq. he had a numerous family. First,&mdash;Anne, the eldest
daughter, was married to Isaac Dobree, Esq., and is now living a widow:
she has four daughters, all married. Charlotte, second daughter, married
Nicholas Peter Dobree, rector of St. Mary. Mary, the third daughter, is
unmarried. Carteret, fourth daughter, married Peter Lihou, Esq. colonel
of militia. Philip, the eldest son, was a lieutenant in the Royal Navy,
and died at Gibraltar, 1774. John, the second son, surgeon-general to
His Majesty's forces on the island, became heir to his father; he
married Judith, daughter of William Brock, Esq. sister of Harriet, wife
of Sir Thomas. James, was the third son, and first Lord de Saumarez. Sir
Thomas, the fourth son, was born at Guernsey, 1st July 1760, and entered
the army at the age of 15.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> He married Harriet, daughter of William

<h4>THE ACTION OFF DOGGER BANK.</h4>
<p class="1"></p>

<p class="right">"Fortitude, at Sea, 6th August 1781.</p>
<p class="smcap">"Sir,</p>

<p>"Yesterday we fell in with the Dutch squadron, with a large convoy, on
the Dogger bank: I was happy to find I had the wind of them, as the
great number of their large frigates might otherwise have endangered
my convoy. Having separated the men of war from the merchant ships,
and made the signal to the last to keep their wind, I bore away with
the general signal to chase. The enemy formed their line, consisting
of eight two-decked ships; ours, including the Dolphin, consisting of
seven. Not a gun was fired on either side until within the distance of
half-musket shot; the Fortitude being then abreast of the Dutch
Admiral, the action began and continued with unceasing fire for three
hours and forty minutes: by this time our ships were unmanageable. I
made an effort to form the line, in order to renew the action, but
found it impracticable; the Bienfaisant had lost her fore-topmast, and
the Buffalo her fore-yard; the rest of the ships were not less
shattered in their masts, rigging, and sails. The enemy appeared to be
in as bad a condition; both squadrons lay a considerable time near
each other, when the Dutch with their convoy bore away for the Texel.
We were not in a condition to follow them.</p>

<p>"His Majesty's officers and men behaved with great bravery, nor did
the enemy show less gallantry. The Fortitude was extremely well
seconded by Captain Macartney in the Princess Amelia, but he was
unfortunately killed early in the action; Lieutenant Hill has great
merit in so well supporting the conduct of his brave Captain.</p>

<p>"As there was great probability of our coming into action again,
Captain Macbride very readily obliged me by taking command of that
ship, and I have appointed Mr. Waghorne,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span> my first lieutenant, to the
command of the Artois. This gentleman, although much hurt in the
action, refused to leave my side while it lasted. Captain Græme, of
the Preston, has lost an arm.</p>

<p>"Inclosed, I transmit a list of the killed and wounded, and an account
of the damage sustained by the ships.</p>

<p>"The enemy's force was, I believe, much superior to what their
Lordships apprehended; and I flatter myself they will be satisfied
that we have done all that was possible with ours.</p>

<p class="left50">"I am, Sir,<br />
<span class="i1">"Your most obedient and most humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right smcap">"H. Parker.</p>

<p>"P.S. The frigates this morning discovered one of the Dutch men-of-war
sunk in twenty-two fathoms water; her top-gallant masts were above the
surface, which Captain Patton has struck and brought to me on board: I
believe she was the second ship of the line of 74 guns."</p>

<h4>DUTCH ACCOUNT OF THE ACTION OFF DOGGER BANK.</h4>
<p class="p2"></p>

<p>"Sunday, August 5th, 1781, at break of day, between the hours of three
and four in the morning, we saw a great number of strange ships to the
N.N.W. of us; we got everything ready for an engagement: the wind was
N.E. and our course was N.W. We made the signal to form the line of
battle at a cable's length distance from each other as we advanced.
The Ajax cutter, Captain Count Welderen, came up in the mean time to
make a report that the fleet he saw was a convoy of the enemy, which
had sailed on the 26th through the Sound, escorted by eleven English
men-of-war and four cutters. At seven o'clock the ships-of-war hoisted
their English colours, among which was a Vice-admiral's flag, and bore
down upon us, their convoy remaining to windward. I made the signal to
tack, and we came up thus in order of battle, and took our station to
the E.S.E., and ordered our merchantmen to the westward. We saw that
the eight English men-of-war that bore down upon us in a line, were
sixty, seventy-four, ninety, and one of forty guns. At eight the
English Vice-admiral being abreast to windward of me, they turned with
us, and the action began. At that instant the fire was very brisk on
both sides, and the whole line was engaged. I was constantly and very
briskly cannonaded by two large ships. The engagement lasted till
half-past eleven, and was very bloody. Our ships, mine included, were
greatly disabled, and received so much damage that they could not be
worked any longer. The English Admiral must have equally suffered, for
he wore to the eastward. At noon we took down the signal to engage,
and bore away to the westward to repair our ships as much as possible,
all being extremely crippled by the constant fire of so long an
engagement. We perceived also that the English Vice-admiral tacked
about half-past twelve with his ships, and stood to the N.W., where he
remained floating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span> to repair also their damage. Among their ships we
saw also a three-decker, whose main topmast fell by the board.</p>

<p>"We found ourselves at noon in fifty-five degrees, fifty-six minutes
N. and consequently the point of Ternaus in Norway, N.N.E. <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span> N.
thirty leagues from us. All the ships-of-war were become
unserviceable: we made the signal for the convoy to run it, with the
frigates the Medenblik and Venus, and put themselves according to
circumstances out of danger, to avoid being taken, or falling into the
hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>"In bearing away the Batavier, whose mizen-yard was turned upside down,
and who had lost her mizen topmasts, she almost fell on her side: one
of her officers cried out to us her captain was wounded, and the ship
so disabled she was no longer manageable. I sent two frigates to
assist and take her in tow; but before they could come up with the
Batavier, she drove before the wind, and came up to us.</p>

<p>"Captain Kinsbergen sent a boat with Captain Abreson and Captain
Staring to report their situation, and that they were much crippled.
I told them that as soon as we should be a little refitted and able to
manage the ships, I would make the signal to return to port. Captain
Dedel made the signal of being greatly damaged; Captain Van Braam that
he was much embarrassed. I made the signal for the Zephyr frigate to
come alongside. She reported having spoken to Captain Van Braam, and
that his ship had some shots under water; I sent her off immediately
to give all possible assistance to Captains Van Braam and Dedel.</p>

<p>"In the mean time Captain Dedel fired guns of distress, and steered
his course southward towards the coast of Holland. I made the signal
for Captain Van Weenzel to come to speak to me, and I despatched him to
assist Captain Dedel, with orders to stay with him and to seek a port.
Between four and five <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> I made signal to sail, upon which all the
ships near us repeated the signal to Captain Kinsbergen, and bore
away as well as they could with what they could make use of. I came
near to Captain Van Braam, who cried out to me that he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span> several shots
under water; that his ship made much water, but was now much
diminished by the help of the pumps. In the evening we saw all the
ships under sail with us.</p>

<p>"The Admiral de Ruyter has many killed and wounded, and is, as well as
the ships in general, damaged in their hull, masts, and rigging; but I
hope, with the help of God, we shall be able to gain a port of the
republic.</p>

<p>"I send this despatch by Count de Welderen, who can in person make a
more ample report to your Serene Highness.</p>

<p>"I have the honour to commend myself to the gracious protection of
your Serene Highness; and to subscribe myself with respect,</p>

<p class="left50">"Your Serene Highness's<br />
<span class="i1">"Most humble and obedient servant,</span></p>
<p class="right smcap">"J.A. Zoutman."</p>

<p>"Dated on board the Admiral de Ruyter, 7th August 1781,<br />
<span class="i2">Kykduyn, bearing south eighteen miles from us.</span></p>

<p>"N.B. All the officers and men on board the ships displayed a constant
courage, fought like lions, as well as my own people, all of whom, I
am extremely well satisfied with, from all the information I have
received at present."</p>

<h4>LETTER WRITTEN BY H.S.H. THE STADTHOLDER, ADDRESSED AS FOLLOWS.</h4>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p>"Noble, respectable, virtuous, well-beloved, and trusty
subjects!&mdash;We have learnt with the highest satisfaction that the
squadron of the State under Rear-admiral Zoutman, although much
inferior in ships, guns, and men, to the English squadron of
Vice-admiral Parker, did, on the 5th instant, so valiantly resist its
attack, that the English fleet, after an obstinate engagement, which
lasted from eight in the morning till half an hour past eleven, was
obliged to cease firing and retire. The heroic courage with which
Rear-admiral Zoutman, the captains, officers, and subalterns, common
sailors, and soldiers, concerned in the action, and who, through the
blessing of Almighty God, so well discharged their duty during the
engagement, merits our particular approbation and praise; therefore we
have thought proper, by this present, to write, to thank publicly, in
our name, the said rear-admiral, captains, officers, subalterns,
sailors, and soldiers, by causing it to be read on board every ship
which partook in the action, and whose captains and crews fought with
such valour; and that an authentic copy of it be delivered by the
secretary of the fleet to the State, as well as to the said
Rear-admiral Zoutman, as the commander of the ships under his orders
with whose conduct the said admiral has reason to be satisfied;
further testifying that we doubt not that they, and all the officers
of the state, sailors and soldiers, will, on every occasion that may
offer, give proofs that the State wants not defenders of their dear
country and its liberty; and that the ancient heroic valour of the
Batavians still exists, and will never be extinct.</p>

<p>"Wherefore, noble, respectable, virtuous, and well-beloved subjects,
we recommend you to the Divine protection.</p>

<h4>ADMIRAL RODNEY'S LETTER.</h4>

<p class="p2"></p>
<p>"On the 5th of April I received intelligence that the enemy were
embarking their troops on board the ships-of-war, and concluded that
they intended to sail in a few days. Captain Byron of the Andromache,
an active and diligent officer, watched their motions with such
attention, that on the 8th inst. at day-light he made out the enemy's
signal of coming out and standing to N.W. I instantly made the signal
to weigh, and having looked into the Bays of Fort Royal and St.
Pierre, I made signal for a general chase, and before day-light came
up with the enemy under Dominique, where both fleets were becalmed,
and continued so for some time. The enemy first got the wind, and
stood towards Guadaloupe.</p>

<p>"My van division, under that gallant officer Sir Samuel Hood, received
it next, and stood after them. At nine the enemy began to cannonade my
van, which was returned with the greatest briskness. The baffling
winds did not permit part of the centre division to get into action
with the enemy's rear till half-past eleven; and then only the ship
next me in line of battle, &amp;c. The enemy's cannonade ceased upon
my rear's approach, but not before they had done considerable damage
to the ships in the van, and disabled the Royal Oak and Montague,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>"The night of the 9th inst. the fleet lay-to to repair their damages.
The 10th they continued to turn to windward under a very easy sail,
the enemy continuing to do the same; and always had it in their power
to come into action, which they cautiously avoided, and rendered it
impossible for me to force them in the situation they were in, between
the Saints and the island of Dominique.</p>

<p>"On the 11th, the enemy having gained considerably to the windward,
and the wind blowing a fresh steady gale, I made the signal for a
general chase to windward, which continued the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span> whole day; and towards
sunset one of the enemy's ships, damaged in the late action, falling
to leeward, the Count de Grasse bore down with his whole fleet to her
protection, which brought him so near that I flattered myself he would
give me an opportunity of engaging him next day. With that view I
threw out the signal for the form of sailing, and stood with the whole
fleet to the southward till two in the morning, then tacked, and had
the happiness, at day-light, to find my most sanguine desire was near
being accomplished, by my having it in my power to force the enemy to
battle."</p>

<p>Note from Lord Rodney's narrative contained in a private letter.</p>

<p>"The 10th of April and the 11th were employed in endeavouring to bring
the enemy to battle, and on the 11th, late in the afternoon, the enemy
bore down to protect two of their own ships, who were in danger of
being cut off. This brought them to the position the Admiral wished;
he instantly issued orders to sail during the night in the order of
sailing; to put out all lights; to stand to the southward till two in
the morning, and then the whole fleet to tack without signal. This
deceived the enemy, who had no conception that the British fleet
should be so near them at day-light: we instantly formed the line of
battle on our starboard tack, the enemy formed theirs on the larboard
tack, and had made the signal to wear; but the nearness of the British
squadron prevented its being put into execution; and the British fleet
taking the lee gage, the Admiral made the signal to engage and close."</p>

<p>Captain Tornquist said, that after the Russell gave the Northumberland
her first broadside, the helm was put up, and a great number of the
crew ran from their quarters; the Couronne bore up also at the same
time, and left the Ville de Paris, which had exchanged broadsides with
several ships, but was never closely engaged but by the Russell. He
says that the Barfleur did not fire a shot at the Ville de Paris.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span></p>

<p class="right">Russell, 12th April 1782,<br />
off Dominica, E.S.E. 4 or 5 leagues.</p>
<p>Wind, East by North.</p>

<p>Friday 12th, fresh breezes and fine weather. At five <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> the Admiral
made the signal to close in the order of sailing. At six, the
America's signal to go ahead and carry a light during the night. At
half-past seven saw the flashes and heard the report of several guns
to windward, supposed to be from the French fleet. At half-past one
<span class="smcap">a.m.</span> the Admiral made the signal to tack. At sunrise saw the French
fleet to the northward about three leagues. At half-past five the
Admiral made the signal to form a line ahead, and for the blue
division to lead. At six, the Conqueror's signal was made to chase to
the N.W. At half-past six the Admiral made the signal for the line to
form N.N.E. and S.S.W, two cables' length asunder, and for the third
in command to lead; the French fleet to windward forming the line
ahead, standing to the southward. At seven the Admiral made the signal
for all cruisers to come in and to close the line one cable's length
asunder. At thirty-eight minutes past seven the Admiral made our
signal for being out of our station; forty minutes past, the signal
for the fleet to close in a line of battle; forty-three minutes past,
repeated it; our fleet in a line ahead standing to the southward. At
three quarters past seven the enemy began firing on our van. The
Admiral made the signal for action&mdash;our van began to engage the
enemy's van. Fifty minutes past seven we backed the main topsail, and
began to engage. Fifty minutes past eight, engaging the enemy very
close, backed and filled occasionally; at nine luffed up and backed
the main topsail, and raked the enemy's sternmost ships. Having passed
all their line, ceased firing, the centre and rear still engaging as
they passed the enemy. Our masts, yards, sails, and rigging, very much
damaged; the mizen-mast, dangerously wounded, struck the mizen yard,
and sent topgallant-masts and yards down upon deck, unbent the mizen
topsail, a spritsail, topsail, and a jib for a mizen. At twenty-five
minutes past nine saw the Prince<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span> George to leeward without a
fore-mast. Employed fishing the fore and mizen topsail yards, and
fitting the rigging, and shifting powder from forward to aft, and
cleared the decks up ready for action. At half-past nine wore to stand
for the enemy. At ten the Admiral made the signal for the commander of
the third post to tack and gain the wind of the enemy; the signal for
engaging flying, and the signal for the line, hauled down. At three
minutes past eleven the Admiral made the signal for the van to tack:
saw one of the enemy's ships with all her masts and bowsprit shot
away; Sir Samuel Hood's division and part of the centre still engaging
the enemy's fleet: the rear, having been broke through, bore away.</p>

<p class="center">13th <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Body of Dominica E.S.E. 9 or 10 leagues, Wind, Noon, E.S.E.</p>

<p>The van and centre, engaging at forty minutes past seven, wore to the
southward. The topsail-yard being fished, set the fore topsail
standing for the enemy's fleet; people employed repairing the rigging.
At half-past one the Admiral made the Alert's signal to come within
hail. At twenty minutes past two he made the Royal Oak's signal to
take the French ship in tow that was dismasted, part of the fleet
still engaging. The Admiral made the Bedford's signal to get into her
station. One of the French ships struck to the van. Coming up with the
enemy's fleet, beat to quarters. Forty minutes past three we began to
engage some of the enemy's ships to leeward on contrary tacks. At ten
minutes past four, having passed them, ceased firing and hauled up the
courses; wore ship ahead of the Formidable two of the enemy's ships
struck their colours. At half-past four the Admiral made the
Conqueror's signal to make more sail. At a quarter past five he made
the signal to close in line of battle; set the foresail. At six bore
down, and ran under the Ville de Paris' stern, raked her, then hauled
up after her; at twenty minutes past six saw her strike her colours.
At seven <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> the Admiral made the night-signal for the fleet to
bring-to on the starboard tack; shortened sail, hauled our wind, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
backed the main topsail, some of the fleet engaging to leeward.
During the action we had ten men killed and twenty-nine wounded; the
French fleet going away with all sail set to the N.W. At half-past
eleven, saw a ship on fire blow up.</p>

<p>On the 4th of March, at half-past three, the Russell struck on a rock
and damaged her rudder and stern frame; at eight weighed and run
further out. On the 5th, at four, made the signal for assistance, and
went to the Carenage. On the 6th, warped in and unhung her rudder,
sent it on shore, and found that all the lower pentles were broken
off. 11th, came out of the Carenage; fifteen men deserted; in coming
out, she again struck on a rock. Before the action, she received
twenty-three men from the Shrewsbury.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Lord Rodney's Victory.&mdash;Canada's Log, 12th April 1782.</i></p>

<p>April 12th, at daylight, six, moderate and cloudy. Quarter past seven
the Admiral made the signal to call in all cruisers. At twenty-five
past seven he made the signal for the line of battle ahead a cable's
length asunder. The enemy formed a line of battle ahead on the
larboard tack, standing to the south, and we formed the line of battle
ahead on the starboard tack, and stood to the northward. At eight the
Admiral made the Russell's signal to get into her station; at five
past eight, he made the signal to close. At fifty past seven, the van
of our fleet began to engage, as did all the other ships as they came
abreast of enemy. There was a great interval in the enemy's line; our
fleet cut through to windward about twelve ships of them. At twenty
past eight the enemy's ships, as they passed, began firing at us; at
twenty-five past eight we began to engage. At twenty past nine one of
the enemy's ship's main and mizen-masts went over the stern just as
she got abreast of our quarter, and soon after our fore-mast and
bowsprit went also. At twenty-five past nine, having passed the
enemy's fleet, some of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span> whom went to leeward of us, the Admiral made
the signal to tack. At thirty-eight past ten he hoisted signal for the
commander of the third post to make more sail; observed the Duke's
main topmast go over the side. At fifty past ten, observed the Prince
George with her fore topmast gone. We ceased firing, as did most of
the ships on both sides, except Sir S. Hood and some of the squadron
who were to windward, who exchanged a good many shots with the enemy,
as he bore down. At eleven, observed that the Admiral had hauled down
the signal for the line; at five past eleven the Admiral made the
signal to tack; wore at three quarters past eleven. We fired several
shots at the enemy, to try the distance, but finding they did not
reach, ceased firing. At fifty past eleven the Admiral made the
Conqueror's signal to tack, and made and shortened sail occasionally.
Wind, E. <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> E.S.E. 13th (at noon) <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, moderate and clear,
inclinable to calm. At five <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> the Admiral made the Endymion's
signal to stay by a disabled ship in the N.W. At ten <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> one of our
ships ahead fired a good many shots at a frigate, which had a disabled
ship of the enemy in tow; and soon after the frigate cast her off. We
fired several shots, at times, to try the distance. At twenty-three,
<span class="smcap">p.m.</span> the Admiral made the signal that the van were at too great a
distance from the centre; the ships astern exchanged a good many shots
with the enemy as they came up with them. At fifty <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> the Admiral
made the Alcides and Marlborough signal to make more sail; at
fifty-three, <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> to engage close; fired several shots, at times, to
try the distance. At a quarter past one, two of our ships to windward
exchanged a good many shots with the enemy. At half-past one the
Admiral made our signal to close; twenty-five past one, we began to
engage; at fifty past one the Admiral made the signal to the Monarch
to get into her station. At twelve past two he made the Alert signal
to come within hail; half-past two he made the Royal Oak's signal to
take the ship in tow that had struck her colours. At twenty-two past
two the Admiral made the Resolution signal to tack, and we
discontinued engaging. At twenty-three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span> past two some of our ships
upon our larboard beam began firing, as did the rest of the ships as
they came up with the enemy. At three quarters past three the Admiral
made the Repulse and Alcides signal to bear down. At four the Admiral
made the signal to veer; at seven past four the Admiral made the
Torbay signal to veer; at twenty past four a French line-of-battle
ship struck to us after engaging her eighteen minutes. At a quarter
past four the Admiral made the Repulse and Resolution signals to make
more sail; at three quarters past, Sir S. Hood steering after some
enemy's ships to the N.W. About this time the firing ceased on both
sides. At fifty past four the Admiral made the signal for the first
ships to bear down. At five we began to engage; at a quarter past five
our ships engaging as they came up; at fifty-five past five observed
another French line-of-battle ship had struck her colours. At five
past six the Admiral made the signal to the Princess and Bedford to
get into their stations. At thirty-five past six observed that the
Ville de Paris had struck her colours. At forty past six discontinued
the engagement. At seven beat the retreat. At nine, saw a ship on
fire, and another soon after blow up, all without the main topsail.

<hr class="c15" />
<p>Although in the above logs, and in several others which we have
examined at the depôt, by permission from the Lords of the Admiralty,
it does appear that the Canada was engaged with the Ville de Paris,
yet we have no doubt of the fact, having the testimonies of Sir L.
Halsted and Admiral Giffard, who were in the Canada on the 12th of
April, extracts of whose letters we subjoin, which also prove that the
Canada was not the ship that was engaging the Ville de Paris when the
Barfleur came up, and when the French Admiral struck his colours. Sir
Lawrence Halsted, in his letter to us, after giving a brief account of
the capture of the Hector, and of the Canada's previous and subsequent
attack on the Ville de Paris, relates, that the Canada, on seeing some
ships bearing down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span> on the Ville de Paris, of which, he believes, one
was the Russell, "bore up in pursuit of a French Rear-admiral in the
Triomphant 84;" and he concludes, "I trust that that part in Lord de
Saumarez' letter is satisfactorily answered, as it is quite clear that
the Canada was not near the Ville de Paris at the time she
surrendered." Admiral Giffard, in answer to our application, says,</p>

<p>"I am of opinion the Canada was engaged with the Ville de Paris
earlier in the day than the Russell."</p>
<hr class="c15" />

<p>Extract of a letter from Capt. G.W.H. Knight, R.N., son of the late
Admiral Sir John Knight, K.C.B., who was captain of the Barfleur on
the 12th April, 1782.</p>

<p>"I have never been able to lay my hand on my father's letter, wherein
he gave me some account of the 12th of April 1782, but this I
recollect quite well, that he said, 'he accompanied Sir Samuel
(afterwards Lord Hood) on board Lord Rodney's ship the day before the
battle of the 9th of April, (my father being captain of the Barfleur,
Sir Samuel's flag ship,) and on that occasion not one word was said,
or order given, for any attempt to break through the enemy's line in
the expected engagement, nor was any order afterwards given previous
to the 12th of April. That on the 9th, the van squadron, commanded by
Sir S. Hood, which was most engaged, made no attempt to break the
line, nor did the van or centre (the line being inverted) on the 12th
make any such attempt; and my father attributed the Formidable, and
those that followed her, getting through, to the circumstance of a
change of wind, which brought those ships up with the rest of the rear
of the British fleet, while it broke off the ships in the French line,
and consequently left openings.' He further said, 'that from the
density of the smoke they could see nothing, and that the first
intimation they had (the Barfleur) of passing through the enemy's line
was, from receiving fire on both sides.' He gave another reason for
supposing it was altogether accidental, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span> was, that no attempt
was made or order given by signal to double on the enemy, and that the
advantage gained by passing through the line was never made use of
when my father took possession of the Ville de Paris, and received
Count de Grasse's sword, and afterward conveyed him to his Admiral; no
remark was made upon any circumstance having taken place different
from the usual practice. These are the heads of what I recollect."</p></div>

<p class="right">Orion, St Helen's Roads, 30th December 1796.</p>
<p class="smcap">My Lord,</p>

<p>I have had it in contemplation for some time past, to lay before your
Lordships the enclosed plan for the establishment of a Marine
Artillery for the service of the Navy, but was prevented from doing it
by the late prospect of a peace; at present, as the haughtiness of our
enemies seems to have removed that desirable object to a distant
period, and as a further augmentation to our forces may in consequence
take place, it may not appear unseasonable.</p>

<p>If it has the good fortune to meet with your Lordship's approbation, I
shall think myself amply recompensed for the time I have bestowed upon
it.</p>

<p class="left45">I have the honour to be,<br />
<span class="i1">My Lord,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Your Lordship's most obedient</span><br />
<span class="i3">And very humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right smcap">James Saumarez.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>

<p class="center smcap">a plan for forming a corps of artillery for his majesty's naval
service.</p>

<p>"In consequence of the present great increase of the royal navy, it
becomes from time to time necessary to augment proportionably that
very useful body of men, the Marines,&mdash;but that very respectable corps
would be rendered of far greater importance to the service, were they
trained up and exercised in the management of the great guns; for
which purpose it is humbly submitted, that a division be established
at either Woolwich or Deptford, to be composed of drafts from the
divisions of Portsmouth, Plymouth, and Chatham, in order to be
instructed in the exercise and use of artillery; and thereby become
expert gunners when ordered to be embarked on board His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span> Majesty's
ships; their numbers to consist of one man to every four guns in each
line-of-battle ship, which would compose about one third of their
present complement. In addition to which, two companies should be
quartered at the other three divisions, to complete such vacancies as
occasionally would occur on board the fleet.</p>

<p>"The great utility of this corps must appear obvious when it is
considered that the only person supposed to be qualified and
experienced in gunnery on board His Majesty's ships, is the gunner,
who, too often ignorant of his own duty, is totally unable to instruct
others. In the quarter bills of most ships, it is well known that a
very small proportion of the marines are reserved for musketry, the
greater part being in general divided on the different batteries. With
what advantage would they not go to their quarters, after having been
well practised and exercised as artillery-men; and how soon would not
the rest of the ship's company become also expert gunners in emulating
their example.</p>

<p>"These men would also be found particularly useful on expeditions
abroad, in landing or making a descent on the enemy's coast, when a
well-served artillery is often of the greatest importance.</p>

<p>"The officers might be appointed from the other divisions, and should
consist of those who, from their age and services, were incapable of
being engaged in actual duty;&mdash;they would here find a comfortable
asylum during life, and end their days in the service of their
country.</p>

<p>"The expenses incurred by this establishment would be inconsiderable;
and no doubt can be entertained of its proving a lasting advantage to
His Majesty's service, and adding strength to the great bulwark of
this country,&mdash;the Royal Navy.</p>

<p class="right">"Admiralty, 2nd January 1797.</p>

<p class="smcap">"Dear Sir,</p>

<p>"I hazard a line in the uncertainty whether you may not have sailed
before this reaches Portsmouth, to thank you for your paper on the
establishment of a Corps of Artillery for the naval service. The idea
is one which I have often heard discussed, and in many points of view
a very good one; but I fear that there would be so many difficulties
in point of official arrangements to overcome in carrying it into
execution, that no very sanguine hopes can be entertained of its
succeeding.</p>

<p>"It is, however, a subject well worthy of attention, and which, at a
less pressing moment, it may perhaps be worth while to renew.</p>

<div class="font95">
<p class="p2"></p>

<p class="right">"Madrid, 10th March 1797.</p>

<p>"The following account of the action with the British squadron, on the
14th day of February last, has been received by D. Juan de Langara, in
a letter addressed to his Excellency by D. Joseph de Cordova,
commander-in-chief of the Squadron, dated del Oceano, the 2nd of
March, at the entrance of Cadiz Bay.</p>

<p>"From the instant of my proceeding to sea, after securing the gun-boat
at Algeziras, I had the winds E.N.E. to S.E. that drove me to the
latitude of Cape St. Vincent; however, on the morning of the 14th, it
changing to the west, I steered to the E.S.E., and formed in three
separate columns, in the order of sailing with convoy. Several vessels
from the left, at nine o'clock in the morning, observing a strange
sail, I ordered the Principe de Asturias to chase; shortly after, the
St. Firmin and the Pearl frigate discovered the number to increase to
eight sail, and although the foggy weather prevented their being seen
from the Trinidad, I forced the whole squadron to a press of sail; but
counting already at ten o'clock from fifteen to eighteen of the
enemy's ships, besides several frigates, I ordered our squadron to
form immediately the line of battle, in the best manner possible, on
the larboard tack, to maintain the weather gage. In tacking, the ships
Principe, Conde-de-Regla, and Oriente, fell so much to leeward, that
they were unable to join in the line without the risk of being cut off
by the enemy, that now, but at a short distance and under a press of
sail, met us in the most regular order: in consequence, I ordered
these vessels to tack that they might fall in the rear of the line,
which, although done by the two first, could not be effected by the
Oriente, and she ran to leeward of the enemy.</p>

<p>"At a quarter before eleven, from the position of the squadron, the
enemy's headmost ship commenced the action with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span> nearest situated
to her ahead of the Trinidad, running along the whole of our rear, and
successively bearing up before the wind. The Trinidad happened to be
the last of our line, and consequently the centre and van remained out
of the action.</p>

<p>"The rear of the enemy sailed but slowly, and for this reason, as well
as to benefit by some means the fire from our van, I made a signal at
half-past eleven for all the ships ahead to tack, in order to come
round the enemy and attack their rear. My ordering this man&oelig;uvre
appeared the most opportune for many weighty reasons; but,
misunderstood by the ships to which it was directed, I now looked upon
the loss of the Principe, Regla, and the whole of our rear, as
unavoidable. The favourable moment for this movement being lost, I
made a signal for the whole squadron to bear up at the same time, with
a view to contract our distance with the enemy, and to bring into
action several other ships in our centre and van. At the time of
bearing up, the Trinidad was ahead in close action with the enemy,
within musket-shot, and having been engaged by the whole English line,
was very much damaged.</p>

<p>"So soon as their headmost ship had passed athwart our stern, she
tacked, followed by five or six others passing our line to windward;
the remaining ten ships, that were before on our larboard side, then
bore up at the same time, and passed through our line in different
positions, and consequently remained on the other tack fighting us in
great order, with a heavy and well-directed fire: this man&oelig;uvre
decided the action in their favour. I did not fail to guard against
this from the commencement, and anticipated it by ordering the ships
ahead to tack and gain the enemy's rear to leeward; and if the
commanders of the Principe, Regla, Oriente, and Firmin had availed
themselves of the opportunity to join six or eight ships of the van,
they would have placed the enemy between two fires, and terminated the
action in a very different manner.</p>

<p>"Although the Principe and Regla were not able to fall into the rear
of our line, they notwithstanding did their utmost from their
situation, engaging the enemy at the time of passing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span> our line, till
they had obtained the weather gage. The attack of the enemy was now
principally on the Trinidad, which, from the crippled situation of her
mast and rigging, fell to leeward. By word of mouth, and by signals,
the Salvador, San Josef, Soberano, and San Nicholas were ordered to
shorten sail, and to form in our rear, which they executed with
celerity, maintaining a severe action. The van continually remaining
to windward, at two I made them a signal to shorten sail, and bear
down for a general attack.</p>

<p>"The Mexicano formed upon our bow about three in the afternoon, and
engaged the foremost ship of the enemy's line; they now for the
remainder of the day fixed their whole attention against the San
Josef, Mexicano, San Nicholas, and San Yisidro, which were the only
ships that bore the principal and hottest part of the action against
the whole enemy's squadron.</p>

<p>"In this situation it would have been highly expedient that our centre
and van should have come to our support, but it was out of my power to
intimate to them the necessity of this movement, the ships being in
want of masts, rigging, and every necessary for making signals. I
cannot refrain from giving due praise to the valour of the
above-mentioned ships formed at my stern, and expressing the gallant
manner in which they behaved during the engagement: but at length,
being dismasted and destroyed, some struck, and others left the
action. The Trinidad was attacked the whole afternoon by a
three-decker, and three ships of 74 guns, that raked her fore and aft
at pistol-shot; and notwithstanding her having upwards of two hundred
men killed and wounded, she still continued the action for a full hour
longer. Such was the dreadful situation of the Trinidad at six
o'clock, after an uninterrupted engagement, when the San Pablo and
Pelayo, that in the morning had been detached by my orders, and
crowded every sail from the moment of observing the action, now
reached the squadron.</p>

<p>"The reinforcement of these two ships happened at the opportune
junction of the Conde-de-Regla; the Principe arrived shortly after,
and the enemy, observing our van standing towards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span> them, immediately
retired together, covering the captured ships San Josef, Salvador, San
Yisidro, and San Nicholas.</p>

<p>"No one will be surprised at the ultimate consequences of the action,
when the series of misfortunes and unforeseen events from the moment
of our seeing the enemy is considered; and further, that when
cruising, they should sail in a readier condition to form the line of
battle than could be performed by our squadron, in the order of
sailing with convoy, with the wind on our quarter. For the above
reason, scarcely were they discovered, than they formed in regular
order of battle, and so near as to oblige my forming the line hastily,
without attention to posts, or the consequences that might result from
this bad position of the ships and commanders; to which must be added,
that the Pelayo and San Pablo were ahead by order,&mdash;that the Firmin
and Oriente remained to leeward of both lines,&mdash;that notwithstanding
the exertions made by the Principe, Regla, and Firmin, they did not
enter into the line till the afternoon, the latter wanting a
foretop-mast. So that of all the ships of my squadron, only seventeen
formed in the line of battle, the St. Domingo included in the number,
loaded with quicksilver, and of very inconsiderable force. Of the
seventeen above mentioned, some were in action only at intervals, and
many did not fire a gun; resulting from the circumstance of the
enemy's line being entirely engaged against six Spanish ships, and
their defence is the more praiseworthy, as they were all in want of
men. The Trinidad remaining entirely dismasted, without the power of
making signals with flags or lights, I desired Lieutenant General D.
Juan Joachim Moreno to reestablish the line of battle close on the
larboard tack, and gave orders that jury-masts should be fixed on the
Trinidad and the Moredes frigate, to protect her to Cadiz, profiting
by the wind and the situation of the enemy at night-fall.</p>

<p>"I embarked in consequence, with my Major General and Adjutants, on
board the Diana frigate, and ordered several frigates along the line,
that they should observe the order given,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span> and repair the damages with
all haste in order to return again to action. The squadron remained
the whole night on the larboard tack, with the wind at W. to W.N.W.
till six o'clock <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> of the 15th, when I formed on the other tack,
close hauled to the wind.</p>

<p>"My next attention was to inquire by signal the situation of the ships
for action,&mdash;and it proved that the Concepcion, Mexicano, and Soberano
<i>were not in a state to renew the action</i>; and that the Regla,
Oriente, San Pablo, Pelayo, and San Antonio <i>could enter into action</i>,
without my being able to gain any information regarding the others.
Nevertheless I continued my course towards the enemy, that to the
number of twenty ships had been seen since eight o'clock at S.S.W. My
opinion as to the state of the ships of the squadron remaining still
indecisive, in the afternoon I desired to know <i>if it was advisable to
attack the enemy</i>; the ships Concepcion, Mexicano, San Pablo,
Soberano, San Domingo, San Ildefonso, Nepomuceno, Atlante, and Firmin
replied in the negative; the Gloriose, Pablo, Regla, and Firmin, <i>that
it was advisable to delay the attack</i>; and only the Principe,
Conquistador, and Pelayo, positively asserted that <i>the attach was
advisable</i>. From the diversity of opinion, and considering the reply
of each commander as an indication of the true state of his respective
ship, I did not think it proper to force a press of sail towards the
enemy, having likewise been informed that the Mexicano, San Domingo,
and Soberano were considerably damaged, and the Atlante in want of
men, which was general in every ship.</p>

<p>"At three o'clock in the afternoon the enemy was still to the E.S.E. I
directed our course S.E. and varied it at five, to S.E. 74 S. to
double Cape St. Vincent; and that every exertion should be made by day
and night to repair the ships that were not very considerably damaged,
I ordered the line at half-past eleven to close on the starboard tack.
On the 16th some of the enemy's cruisers were seen to the S.E. 74 S.
which route I followed at seven o'clock in the evening, with light
winds at S.W. with hopes to see them again the next day,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span> supposing
their destination for Gibraltar. But at ten o'clock in the morning the
Concepcion made a signal that the enemy were at anchor on the left
side of the coast, and informed me she had seen four large ships in
Lagos Bay. Believing that all the enemy's squadron might be likewise
there, I ordered the line to form close on the starboard tack, and
then despatched the Brigida frigate to reconnoitre; she returned,
acquainting me that she had counted the whole force of the enemy at
anchor in the bay.</p>

<p>"The squadron remained, close in-shore the whole afternoon, and part
of the night, when the wind changing to S.E. I left it under an easy
sail.</p>

<p>"No regular account has been received of the killed and wounded, not
having obtained the respective returns from the commanders at the time
of writing: but it was known that in the Conde-de-Regla a cannon ball
at the commencement of the action killed the Xefe de Esquadra, Conde
d'Amblemont, and the splinters wounded the commander, Brigadier D.
Geronime Bravo, and H.D. Cadlos Sellery.</p>

<p class="right">"Vanguard, off the Mouth of the Nile,<br />
3rd August 1798.</p>

<p class="smcap">"My Lord,</p>

<p>"Almighty God has blessed his Majesty's arms in the late battle by a
great victory over the fleet of the enemy, whom I attacked at sunset
on the 1st of August, off the mouth of the Nile. The enemy were moored
in a strong line of battle for defending the entrance of the bay of
shoals, flanked by numerous gun-boats, four frigates, and a battery of
guns and mortars on an island in their van; but nothing could
withstand the squadron your lordship did me the honour to place under
my command. Their high state of discipline is well known to you; and
with the judgment of the captains, together with their valour, and
that of the officers and men of every description, it was absolutely
irresistible. Could anything from my pen add to the characters of the
captains, I would write it with pleasure, but that is impossible.</p>

<p>"I have to regret the loss of Captain Westcott of the Majestic, who
was killed early in the action, but the ship continued to be so well
fought by her first lieutenant, Mr. Cuthbert, that I have given him an
order to command her till your Lordship's pleasure is known.</p>

<p>"The ships of the enemy, all but their two rear ships, are nearly
dismasted, and those two, with two frigates, I am sorry to say, made
their escape; nor was it, I assure you, in my power to prevent them.
Captain Hood most handsomely endeavoured to do it, but I had no ship
in a condition to support the Zealous, and I was obliged to call her
in.</p>

<p>"The support and assistance I received from Captain Berry cannot be
sufficiently expressed. I was wounded in the head, and obliged to be
carried off deck, but the service suffered no loss by that event.
Captain Berry was fully equal to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span> service then going on, and to
him I must beg to refer you for every information relative to this
victory.</p>

<p>"He will present you with the flag of the second in command. That of
the commander-in-chief being in the L'Orient.</p>

<p>"Herewith I transmit you lists of the killed and wounded, and the
lines of battle of ourselves and the French.</p>

<p class="left60">"I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">"Horatio Nelson."</p>
<p>"To Admiral the Earl of St. Vincent, Commander-in-chief,<br />
<span class="i2">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. off Cadiz."</span></p>

<p>The Rear-admiral was created Baron Nelson of the Nile, and of Burnham
Thorpe, in the county of Norfolk. The thanks of both Houses of
Parliament were voted to him, the officers and crews, in the usual
manner. Gold medals were presented to each of the Captains. A pension
of 2000<i>l.</i> a year for life was settled on Nelson. The Irish
Parliament voted him 1000<i>l.</i>; the East India Company 10,000<i>l.</i>; the
city of London a sword, value two hundred guineas, and a sword to each
of the Captains; that to Sir E. Berry was accompanied by the freedom
of the city in a gold box. But Sir James Saumarez received no
distinguished honour, as has been usual, for being second in command,
although no one ever more highly deserved such a mark of approbation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus it appears that the French were superior by more than a fourth to
the British, and certainly still more in weight of metal; and when the
size of the shot is taken comparatively into consideration, and that a
French eighty is equal to a British ninety-eight, the superiority in
the broadsides would be even greater.</p></div>

<p class="smcap">"My Dear Admiral,</p>

<p>"Captain Gage has this instant joined and communicated to me his
orders to proceed off Malta for intelligence; my letter, of
yesterday's date, with which I have charged him, so fully answers the
purport of his mission with respect to that island and the Colossus,
with the store ships and victuallers, that I have directed him to
return to join you at Naples with all possible despatch. I shall send
the Minotaur and Audacious the moment we are clear of the west end of
Sicily.</p>

<p>"The proposals to the French Garrison were first written by me, but it
being thought advisable to send them in the French language, they
underwent some alteration in the translation; but upon the whole, I
hope they will be approved of. I laid a great stress with the Marquis,
before I left him, of the practicability of the William Tell escaping,
and wished much I could have left two of our ships off the island to
watch her and the two frigates more closely. There exists no doubt of

<p>The Portuguese squadron consisted of the Principe Réal, Rainha de
Portugal, San Sebastian, and Alphonso Albuquerque, of 74 guns, under
the Marquis of Niza, a Rear-admiral, Captain Puysigur; Captains Stone,
Michell, and Campbell (English officers), commanded the other three;
to which were added, the Lion, 64, Captain Manley Dixon; the
Incendiary, fire-ship, George Barker (English); and the Portuguese
brig Falcao, Captain Duncan. Sir James having fallen in with them off
Malta, it fell calm, when a deputation from the principal inhabitants
of the island waited on them to request a supply of arms and
ammunition, and having informed the Commodore that the French garrison
at Valetta were subjected to great distress, and that there was reason
to believe that the appearance of the combined squadron would induce
the French to surrender, if summoned, accordingly, on the 25th of
September 1798, with the concurrence of the Marquis of Niza, a flag of
truce was sent in, with the following formal summons.</p>

<p>"Une division de l'armée de sa Majesté Britannique dans la

arrivée devant Malte sous les ordres de Sir James Saumarez, et reunie
à l'escadre de sa Majesté Très-fidelle, commandée par le Contre-Amiral
le Marquis de Niza; dans le dessein de rétablir les habitans de l'isle
de Malte et dépendances dans la libre jouissance de leurs isles,
sommons conjointement la garnison Françoise de la ville et ports de
Malte de nous remettre la ville et les ports et dépendances, ainsi que
les vaisseaux, frégates, et batimens de quelques especes qu'ils soyent
et qui peuvent s'y trouver, à fin que les habitans de l'isle de Malte
puissent se mettre en possession de leurs villes et ports, et rentrer
dans leurs droits de propriétés. En consequence, le Contre-Amiral
Marquis de Niza, au nom de sa Majesté Très-fidelle la Reine de
Portugal, et Sir James Saumarez, au nom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span> de sa Majesté Brittanique le
Roy d'Angleterre, s'engagent et promettent de laisser à la garnison
Françoise la liberté de retourner en France sur les batimens qui leur
seront procurés à cet effet, de les convoyer et escorter; sous la
condition que cette même garnison ne servira pas dans cette guerre
contre les deux puissances dénommées et leurs alliés, jusqu'au moment
où elle seroit regulièrement changée contre les sujets des deux
puissances denommées ou de leurs alliés. La garnison Françoise
maintenant enfermée dans les murs de la ville de la Cité Valete doit
mûrement refléchir aux conséquences funestes qu'entraineroit pour elle
un refus à cette sommation, puisqu'il la laisseroit à la merci des
traitemens que peut inspirer au peuple de l'isle de Malte la haine et
l'animosité que leur a fait naître les mauvais traitemens qu'ils ont
éprouvés des François; et la garnison, après avoir éprouvée les
horreurs de la famine, seroit forcée de s'en remettre à la discrétion
d'un peuple qui ne montrera que les sentimens de sa vengeance. La
garnison Françoise doit savoir que les escadres ne cesseront de
bloquer l'isle de Malte; qu'une autre est devant Alexandrie, employée
à aider les forces navales et de terre du Grand Seigneur à réduire les
troupes Françoises que la disette et les maladies ont pu épargner en
Egypte; et qu'enfin une autre escadre est devant Toulon, dont il ne
peut venir aucun secours.</p>

Sir James having the prizes under his protection, with orders to
convey them to Gibraltar, had no alternative but to proceed, leaving
the Marquis de Niza and his squadron to blockade the port; but before
leaving he supplied the inhabitants with 1500 muskets and a suitable
quantity of ammunition, to which seasonable supply the success which
attended the Maltese in their subsequent efforts to recover their
liberty was mainly attributable.</p>

<p class="smcap">"My Dear Sir,</p>

<p>"In your letter of yesterday, you were pleased to inform me of the
orders which you have received from his Excellency Sir John Jervis, to
deliver the officers and prisoners who came from the frigates Ninfa
and Helena to the person appointed by me. I name for this purpose Don
Juan Deslobbes, lieutenant in the Royal Navy, who will appear before
you, sir, with this credential, in order to treat and settle
respecting the disembarkation of the said prisoners: he will make the
proper report and give a receipt for them on board. I assure you, sir,
that the said officers, or men, shall not serve in war until they
shall be legally allowed. Of this, the officers may pledge their word
of honour on board, or I will receive it when they appear before me.</p>

<p>"You will imagine, sir, much better than I can express, the sense of
gratitude which I feel in hearing of the kind assistance and attention
which you show to the brave men who were wounded, and of the good
accommodation which the officers and men in general have met with.
Together with my gratitude on this account, do me the honour, sir, to
receive the real estimation and respect with which I offer myself to
your services. God guard you, sir, many years!</p>

<h3><a name="APPENDIX_O" id="APPENDIX_O"></a>APPENDIX O.</h3>
<div class="font95">
<p class="p2"></p>

<p>James, (now the Right Honourable and Reverend Baron de Saumarez,)
eldest son of Lord de Saumarez, was born at Guernsey on the 9th
October 1789. Being brought up, almost from infancy, under the
impression that he was intended for the church, and being naturally of
a mild disposition, no idea of any other profession ever entered his
mind&mdash;a circumstance which has excited general regret and considerable
surprise in the naval service; as there can be no doubt that, instead
of being at this day rector of a small living, he would have been at
the very top of the profession of which his heroic father had been so
bright an ornament. Although of the profession which was chosen for
him, and in which his family had little interest, he has proved
himself an excellent and useful member; still it must be confessed
that there is a general feeling of disappointment among the officers
of the navy, that the eldest son of their "acknowledged chief" had not
embraced that honourable service.</p>

<p>In consequence of his father's frequent absence, and change of station
with his ship, it became necessary to send him to a place of
instruction at an earlier age than usual, to avoid the danger of his
being carried about from port to port,&mdash;a circumstance which could not
but be felt severely by his mother. He was accordingly placed at
Newport, in the Isle of Wight, with the Rev. George Richards, where he
remained till the commencement of 1799. It was, however, before he was
sent to school, in the year 1793, that the following occurrence took
place, which will give the reader some idea of the feelings of such a
family, under such circumstances, in time of war. The happiness that
the gallant captain felt in visiting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span> his family when obliged to put
into port, can only be justly appreciated by the affectionate husband
and father who knows the value of such happy moments, snatched as it
were from the fatigue of service, and how great and substantial is the
relief they afford to the anxiety of a naval life! Lady Saumarez was
at this time living at Stonehouse, that she might be at hand to
receive her husband when he put into Plymouth; their eldest son was
his mother's companion. One evening, tidings were brought to her that
the Crescent had arrived and anchored in Cawsand Bay; the boy was
playing in the passage with his nurse, awaiting the appearance of his
father, when at length the short hasty rap was heard! All ran to the
door, and in the hurry of opening it the light was extinguished, and
total darkness obscured the objects of his affection; but the eager,
<i>parental</i> tone with which the words "Where art thou, my darling boy?"
were uttered, left such an impression on the mind and feelings of the
son as never to have been forgotten.</p>

<p>Early in 1799, young Saumarez was removed to the Rev. Mr. Morgan's
grammar school at Bath. Mr. Morgan had the reputation of being an
excellent master to boys of any promise; it may be inferred that he
was of this denomination, as his pupil not only left the school with
an excellent character, but on his going to Harrow, in the autumn of
1801, he was immediately placed on the fourth form, which had the
privilege of being exempt from fagging. We have heard him express the
highest gratification at having been there with Lord Byron and Sir
Robert Peel, who were in the form above him.</p>

<p>At Harrow he employed his time so well, that he reached the head of
the school; having throughout conducted himself to the satisfaction of
Dr. Drury, and afterwards of Dr. Butler, who succeeded as head-master,
for both of whom he entertained a sincere regard.</p>

<p>In the year 1807 he went to Christ Church, Oxford, where, after three
years, he passed his examination for academical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span> honours in a manner
which not only gained him great credit, but, we were told, would have
ensured him the honours of the first class if he had aimed at
obtaining them. In December 1812 he was admitted into deacon's orders
by Dr. Bathurst, bishop of Norwich; and in the year following the
Bishop of Oxford ordained him priest.</p>

<p>In the interval he did duty as curate of Bicester, and afterwards in
the same capacity at Benson; at both which places he so endeared
himself to the parishioners, that the late Dr. Barrington, the revered
and excellent bishop of Durham, told his father that "he had not left
a dry eye in the place." Nor was he less respected and beloved at
Ewelme, where he lived after his marriage, than he was at Staverton,
in Northamptonshire, to which place he removed, and where he resided
several years surrounded by a flock for whom he had the sincerest
regard, preferring to labour in his sacred profession as a curate than
to remain an idle servant in his Master's vineyard. His health
becoming impaired, he was on the point of quitting Staverton, when he
was appointed by Lord Eldon to the living of Huggate in Yorkshire.</p>

<p>His gallant father once paid him a visit at Oxford, when he was an
under-graduate of Christ Church, on which occasion he called on the
celebrated Doctor Jackson, then dean, who manifested great pleasure at
seeing Sir James; and on parting, took him by the hand, and, shaking
his full-bottomed wig, said, "Mind, Sir James, that you act up to your
instructions, and burn, sink, and destroy every Frenchman you meet
with."</p>

<p>On the 5th October 1814, the present Lord de Saumarez married Mary,
the amiable daughter of the late Vice-admiral Lechmere.</p>

<p>Thomas Le Marchant Saumarez, the second son, was born at Teignmouth,
on the 2nd September 1799, and died 2nd November following.</p>

<p>The Honourable Thomas Le Marchant Saumarez, third son, was born at
Guernsey, 30th October 1803; he was educated for the army, and was a
lieutenant in the seventy-first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span> regiment. He was married, on the 1st
October 1829, to Catherine Spencer Beresford, youngest daughter of
Colonel Spencer Thomas Vassall, and died 4th July 1834, without issue.</p>

<p>The Honourable John St. Vincent Saumarez, the fourth son, was born at
Guernsey on the 30th May 1806; he was named after the illustrious and
distinguished Admiral Earl St. Vincent, at a time when his lordship's
friend, the heroic father, was named to command the Channel fleet.</p>

<p>He chose the army for his profession, in which he has served in
America, and other places, and is now a Captain in the Rifle Brigade.
Married on the 2nd July 1838, to Caroline, eldest daughter of William
Rhodes, Esq. of Bromhope Hall, and Kirskill in the county of York.</p>

<p>Mary Dobrée Saumarez, the eldest daughter, was born at Bath on the 7th
December 1792. This beautiful and accomplished young lady was cut off
in the twentieth year of her age, in September 1812, to the
inexpressible grief not only of her affectionate and disconsolate
parents, but of all who had the happiness to be acquainted with her
amiable and excellent qualities.</p>

<p>The Honourable Martha Harriett, second daughter, was born at Bath, and
is residing with her now only parent.</p>

<p>Carteret, the third daughter, was born at Bath the 26th November 1796,
and died young.</p>

<p>The Honourable Amelia, the fourth daughter, was born at Dartmouth, and
was married on the 3rd September 1822, to William Young Herries, Esq.
of Spotts, in Kirkcudbrightshire; they have one son (Alexander), who
is now ten years of age, and is the only grandchild of the illustrious
lord.</p></div>

<p class="smcap">My dear Lord,</p>

<p>It is with great satisfaction I have the honour to inform your
lordship of the capture of the island of Anholt, which, although not a
very productive island, will prove of great importance for the
purposes as stated in my public letters, more particularly when
excluded from the ports of Sweden. Captain Acklom is a very deserving
officer, who has been on the station all the winter; being known to
his grace the Duke of Portland, he flatters himself with the hope of
promotion.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Daniel Ross, acting on board the Kangaroo, is an old
follower of mine, and a most deserving man. I shall feel greatly
obliged to your lordship for his promotion.</p>

<p>I hope to be enabled to sail for the Baltic this evening; but the late
calms and baffling winds have proved against us, and delayed the ships
getting through the Belt.</p>
